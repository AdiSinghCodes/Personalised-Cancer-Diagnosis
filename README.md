# Cancer Diagnosis Project

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately diagnose cancer based on patient data. Early and precise diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. The project aims to leverage data-driven techniques to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Organizer
This project is organized by [Your Organization/Institution Name], dedicated to advancing healthcare solutions through data science and machine learning.

## Solution Approach
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Gathered and cleaned a comprehensive dataset containing patient records and diagnostic results.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed univariate and multivariate analyses to understand data distributions and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Applied domain knowledge to create meaningful features and enhance model performance.
4. **Model Selection & Training:** Evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms to identify the best-performing model.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Used various metrics and confusion matrix analysis to assess model accuracy and reliability.
6. **Deployment:** Deployed the final model using Streamlit for easy accessibility and real-time predictions.

## Univariate Analysis
- Analyzed individual features such as age, tumor size, and cell characteristics.
- Visualized distributions using histograms, boxplots, and density plots.
- Identified outliers and missing values for further processing.

## Feature Engineering Techniques
- Created new features by combining existing ones (e.g., mean radius, mean texture).
- Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
- Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity.
- Applied dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA where necessary.

## Model Usage and Evaluation
- Tested various models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting.
- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Selected the model with the best balance between sensitivity and specificity.

## Confusion Matrix Analysis
- Analyzed true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- Focused on minimizing false negatives to reduce the risk of missed cancer diagnoses.
- Used confusion matrix insights to fine-tune model thresholds.

## Oversampling
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
- Ensured the model is not biased towards the majority class and can detect minority class instances effectively.

## TF-IDF Featureization
- Applied TF-IDF vectorization to textual features (e.g., pathology reports).
- Transformed text data into numerical features for model compatibility.

## Model Training
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Trained the selected model using cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
- Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Deployment on Streamlit
- Built an interactive web application using Streamlit.
- Enabled users to input patient data and receive instant cancer diagnosis predictions.
- Provided visualizations and explanations for model decisions.
