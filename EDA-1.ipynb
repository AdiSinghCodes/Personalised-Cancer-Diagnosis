       "Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, and therefore sequence analysis of both genes is routinely conducted in patients with early-onset breast cancer. Besides mutations that clearly abolish protein function or are known to increase cancer risk, a large number of sequence variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS) have been identifi ed. Although several functional assays for BRCA1 VUSs have been described, thus far it has not been possible to conduct a high-throughput analysis in the context of the full-length protein. We have developed a relatively fast and easy cDNA-based functional assay to classify BRCA1 VUSs based on their ability to functionally complement BRCA1-defi cient mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we have analyzed 74 unclassifi ed BRCA1 missense mutants for which all predicted pathogenic variants are confi ned to the BRCA1 RING and BRCT domains.  SIGNIFICANCE: BRCA1 VUSs are frequently found in patients with hereditary breast or ovarian cancer and present a serious problem for clinical geneticists. This article describes the generation, validation, and application of a reliable high-throughput assay for the functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants of uncertain signifi cance.

INTRODUCTION  Germline loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 are known to result in an approximately tenfold increased lifetime risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer. Thus far, no other genes have been identifi ed with such a strong link to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC), and in the past decades, many women have been screened for germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . This has resulted in the identifi cation of numerous pathogenic mutations as well as a large number of sequence variants for which the clinical relevance is not clear. In the most recent publication of the ENIGMA (Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles) group, an international consortium for the evaluation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variants, a total of 1,273 unique BRCA1 variants is mentioned ( 1 ), but this number may increase even further because of the implementation of high-throughput sequencing methods. Of the BRCA1 variants of uncertain signifi cance (VUS), 920 are nontruncating exonic mutations that may affect protein function or mRNA splicing, but for which there is not enough linkage information to indicate whether they are pathogenic. To aid genetic counseling of individuals with BRCA1/2 VUS, both genetic and functional classifi cation methods have been developed. Genetic analysis of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs relies on cosegregation with disease, cooccurrence with known pathogenic mutations, and family history of cancer. These data have been integrated into computational models to calculate the likelihood that a VUS is disease-causing ( 2 ). Additional in silico analysis of the evolutionary conservation of the amino acids affected by the mutation and the predicted impact of the mutant amino acids on protein folding are also implemented in such models. Functional assays do not rely on preexisting data, but directly test the effect of BRCA1/2 VUSs on known functions of the encoded proteins ( 3 ). Although this may seem relatively straightforward, it can be diffi cult to extrapolate data from functional assays into cancer risks for patients. For instance, in most assays only part of the BRCA1 protein is analyzed. In addition, some of the more elegant assays are technically demanding and not suitable to analyze large numbers of mutations. We reasoned that a good functional assay should fulfi ll three basic requirements: (i) it should investigate the biologic effects of a BRCA1 VUS in the context of the full-length protein; (ii) it should be conducted under normal physiologic conditions in a noncancerous cell type; and (iii) it should be based on a highly standardized and reproducible protocol.  These considerations led us to develop a functional assay based on physiologic expression of full-length human BRCA1 cDNA in mouse embryonic stem cells that are genetically engineered to allow conditional deletion of endogenous Brca1 . Mutant BRCA1 cDNAs are generated using site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) and introduced in a defi ned genomic locus of mouse embryonic stem cells by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). In this way, we have analyzed 86 BRCA1 variants for their effects on cell proliferation and drug sensitivity, including 74 clinically relevant VUSs.  RESULTS  Generation of Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells Expressing BRCA1 Sequence Variants  Although BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells proliferate rapidly in situ , loss of BRCA1 in normal cells leads to a severe proliferation defect ( 4 ).

Brca1 -selectable conditional knockout (SCo) mouse embryonic stem cells ( 5 ). These cells carry one Brca1 -null allele and a selectable conditional Brca1SCo allele, which contains, in addition to loxP sites around exons 5–6, a split puromycin resistance marker that is activated upon Cre-mediated deletion of exons 5–6. They also contain a CreERT2 allele in the Rosa26 locus, which allows for controlled activation of Cre via administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT). Thus, BRCA1-defi cient embryonic stem cells can be easily obtained via 4-OHT–induced inactivation of the Brca1SCo allele and subsequent selection for puromycin resistance ( Fig.  1 ; ref.  5 ). To allow effi cient integration of human BRCA1 variants in one specifi c genomic locus, we supplied the other Rosa26 allele with F3 and Frt recombination sites for RMCE by the site-specifi c recombinase Flp ( Fig.  1 and Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 6 ). Cells that have undergone successful RMCE can be selected because they express a truncated neomycin selection marker under control of the endogenous Rosa26 promoter, which further increases targeting effi ciency. Flpmediated recombination ensures single-copy integration of BRCA1 expression constructs at the same Rosa26 locus, thus avoiding position-effect variegation and copy number– dependent differences in expression.  RMCE vectors were equipped with a human BRCA1 cDNA expression construct, which was modifi ed using SDM to introduce defi ned mutations in BRCA1 . The focus of our analysis was on Dutch and Belgian VUSs that were found in families with HBOC. We also included a number of variants  Figure 1.   Schematic overview of the RMCE procedure in R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Δ embryonic stem cells. Before the introduction of a human BRCA1 cDNA, R26 CreERT2/RMCE ; Brca1 SCo/Δ embryonic stem cells are mouse BRCA1-profi cient and sensitive to both neomycin and puromycin. Targeting of singlecopy human BRCA1 cDNA variants to the Rosa26 locus by Flp RMCE results in expression of human BRCA1 and neomycin resistance. Addition of 4-OHT leads to CreERT2-mediated deletion of mouse Brca1 exons 5 and 6, resulting in loss of mouse BRCA1 protein and concomitant expression of puromycin from the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter. This enables selection of mouse BRCA1-defi cient, human BRCA1-expressing R26 CreERT2/hBRCA1 ; Brca1Δ/Δ embryonic stem cells that can be used in functional complementation assays.

To allow validation of our functional complementation assay, we included a series of eight BRCA1 variants that are known to be deleterious or neutral according to the Breast Cancer Information Core database (BIC; http://research.nhgri .nih.gov/bic/ ; Supplementary Table S1). These controls include the well-known pathogenic BRCA1 founder mutations 185delAG and 5382insC and the neutral polymorphisms Y105C, R866C, and E1250K. The BIC designation is supported by the classifi cation according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( http://iarc.fr/ ), which includes the Align-GVGD score that indicates biophysical and evolutionary alterations ( http://agvgd.iarc.fr/ ; Supplementary Table S1; refs. 11, 12 ). Align-GVGD scores vary between C0 (likely neutral) and C65 (likely deleterious). Sequence-verifi ed constructs that contained the intended VUS, but no other BRCA1 mutations, were transfected into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Δ embryonic stem cells to undergo RMCE ( Fig.  2 ). Neomycin-resistant clones were pooled and RMCE was confi rmed by PCR analysis. Subsequently, protein expression of the human BRCA1 variants was analyzed by Western blot analysis with a human BRCA1-specifi c antibody ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Comparison with BRCA1 protein levels in embryonic stem cells expressing human BRCA1 from a bacterial artifi cial chromosome (BAC), which is known to rescue embryonic lethality of Brca1 -null mice ( 7 ,  13 ), showed that transcription of the human BRCA1 cDNA from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein (Supplementary Fig.  S1). Most BRCA1 variants were expressed at equal levels, allowing comparison of their functional activities. A number of C-terminal BRCA1 mutants showed low levels of expression (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S2). Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that decreased protein expression was not caused by decreased mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig.  S3), suggesting that the low abundance of BRCA1 protein results from posttranslational events. In fact, for most of these variants, mutation-associated protein instability has already been documented in previous publications (refs. 8 , 14 , 15 ; Supplementary Table S2).  Functional Complementation Assay of BRCA1 Sequence Variants in Mouse Brca1 -Null Embryonic Stem Cells  As a fi rst functional test, we assayed the ability of BRCA1 variants to restore the proliferation defect of switched R26 CreERT2/RMCE ;Brca1 SCo/Δ embryonic stem cells ( Fig.  2 ). Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was shut off through overnight induction of Cre activity by 4-OHT, and 7 days  Figure 2.   Workfl ow for the functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants in Brca1 -null embryonic stem (ES) cells.

For each group of mutants tested, we included positive and negative controls consisting of embryonic stem cells containing, respectively, wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA and an empty RMCE vector. BRCA1 variants were evaluated on their ability to support growth compared with these controls (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Although we tested 28 mutations in the central domain encoded by exon 11 (aa 224–1366), BRCA1 variants that were unable to rescue the proliferation defect of Brca1 -null mouse embryonic stem cells to BRCA1 wild-type levels were confi ned to the conserved N- and C-terminal domains of BRCA1.  Cisplatin Sensitivity Assay for Classifi cation of BRCA1 Variants  Although the ability of BRCA1 variants to support proliferation appears to be indicative of VUS function, results were not always clear-cut (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). BRCA1 is known to be important for DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair through mechanisms that are both dependent ( 5 ) and independent ( 16 ) of its function in homologous recombination (HR). The role of BRCA1 in ICL repair is stressed by the occurrence of genetic reversion mutations restoring BRCA1 protein expression in platinum-resistant ovarian tumors in BRCA1 -mutation carriers ( 17, 18 ). We therefore decided to conduct a 96-well–based cisplatin sensitivity assay to allow a more stringent evaluation of BRCA1 VUS functionality.  Half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of cisplatin were determined using a resazurin cell viability assay, and BRCA1 variants were again classifi ed in comparison to wildtype BRCA1 and an empty RMCE vector. To obtain corrected cisplatin IC 50 values, we fi tted a log-logistic curve constrained at 1 and 0. We excluded a fi t if the residual squared error (RSE) exceeded 0.1. We then applied a Bayesian predictor to classify BRCA1 VUS as pathogenic or benign. Most variants that showed less than wild-type activity in the proliferation assay also scored as functionally impaired in the cisplatin sensitivity assay and were classifi ed as deleterious ( Table 1 ,  Table 1.   Functional classifi cation of BRCA1 VUS based on cisplatin response Variant DNA change Type of mutation a Classifi cation S4F c.11C>T VUS Not Clear M18T c.53T>C VUS Deleterious 185delAG c.68_69delAG Deleterious control Deleterious b K45Q c.133A>C VUS Neutral C61G c.181T>G Deleterious control Deleterious C64G c.190T>G VUS Deleterious b D67Y c.199G>T VUS Neutral Y105C c.314A>G Neutral control Neutral N132K c.396C>A VUS Neutral P142H c.425C>A VUS Neutral L147F c.441G>C VUS Neutral L165P c.494T>C VUS Neutral R170W c.508C>T VUS Neutral S186Y c.557C>A VUS Neutral V191I c.571G>A VUS Neutral T231M c.692C>T VUS Neutral D245V c.734A>T VUS Neutral L246V c.736T>G VUS Neutral V271L c.811G>C VUS Neutral S308A c.922A>G; c.923G>C Artifi cial h Not Clear L358R; C360R; E362H c.1073T>G; c.1078T>C; c.1084G>C; c.1086G>T Artifi cial Neutral L668F c.2002C>T VUS Neutral D695N c.2083G>A VUS Neutral P798L c.2393C>T VUS Neutral N810Y c.2428A>T VUS Neutral T826K c.2477C>A VUS Neutral (continued) Downloaded from cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org on May 26, 2017. © 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.

Variants showing increased cisplatin sensitivity were tested at least twice before they were classifi ed. The positive and negative controls classifi ed as expected, although the known pathogenic truncation mutation 5382insC scored as neutral in one of three assays, stressing the need for repeat experiments. Also BRCA1 variants that were previously tested in other assays conducted as expected. It should be noted that the artifi cial variants S308A and S1497A rescued proliferation and cisplatin responses of mouse Brca1 - defi cient embryonic stem cells in BAC complementation assays, but are predicted to be deleterious based on their effects on embryonic stem cell differentiation and their response to γ-irradiation, respectively ( 7 ). The V1804D mutation scored as a neutral variant in our assay, which is in line with most published data ( 8, 9 ), except for the results of an embryonic stem cell–based BAC complementation assay ( 7 ). Again, all BRCA1 mutations that were classifi ed as deleterious were confi ned to regions encoding the conserved N- and C-terminal domains ( Fig.  4 ), despite the observation that deletion of the central region encoded by exon 11 leads to genetic instability in mice ( 12 ). Remarkably, the three mutations that diminish the interaction between BRCA1 and PALB2 ( 10 ), just C-terminal of the region encoded by exon 11, had no effect on cisplatin sensitivity in this assay. Of note, there was in general good correlation between our classifi cation and the Align-GVGD score (Supplementary Table S4). Notable exceptions were the neutral control variant R866C, which validated our assay but scored as likely deleterious (C65) using Align-GVGD, and G1770V, which scored as likely neutral (C0) by Align-GVGD but was classi- fi ed as deleterious in our assay. Our assay also classifi ed some variants for which the Align-GVGD scores were less clear, emphasizing the usefulness of functional assays to complement in silico analysis.  We also analyzed the possible effects of all BRCA1 variants on mRNA splicing, which may have deleterious consequences but cannot be assessed in our cDNA-based assay. The predictive value for exonic variants outside the consensus splice sites is questionable ( 19, 20 ), but four missense mutations were present in existing splice sites (Supplementary Table S4). Although c.5154G>T (encoding W1718C) was deleterious, three of these variants were classifi ed as neutral in our assay. One of them, c.441G>C (encoding L147F), had an increased probability to damage the splice donor site of exon 7. Another variant, c.5072C>T (encoding T1691I), might also affect splicing, but no defect was measured in blood samples of mutation carriers ( 19 ). The third exonic splice site mutation that was classifi ed as neutral in our cisplatin sensitivity assay, c.133A>C (K45Q), is not predicted to lead to aberrant splicing.  Results from Proliferation and Cisplatin Sensitivity Assays Correlate with HR Activity of BRCA1 Variants  BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in DNA repair via HR ( 12 , 21 ). Together with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), HR forms the cellular defense against DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), a severe type of DNA damage that is lethal if unrepaired. Although HR is essentially error-free, NHEJ is error-prone, and therefore defects in HR are known to lead to genomic instability.

Therefore, we used the direct repeat (DR)-GFP assay ( 27 ) to measure the effects on HR for a subset of our BRCA1 VUSs. A number of predicted pathogenic variants and controls were shuttled into R26 CreERT2/RMCE;Brca1 SCo/Δ ;Pim1 DR-GFP/wt embryonic stem cells carrying the DR-GFP reporter in the Pim1 locus. Expression of endogenous mouse Brca1 was switched off, and cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the I-SceI meganuclease as well as an mCherry fl uorescent marker to control for transfection effi ciency. Repair of I-SceI–induced DNA DSBs in DR-GFP via HR leads to expression of GFP, which can be monitored by fl ow cytometry. All but one of the predicted pathogenic variants tested resulted in defective HR, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation ( Fig. 5 ). The only predicted deleterious variant that did not signifi cantly differ from wild-type BRCA1 , R1699Q, seemed to support intermediate levels of HR activity.

It is known that BRCA1- and BRCA2- defi cient cells are extremely sensitive to PARP1 inhibition ( 28, 29 ), leading to a larger dynamic range between BRCA2- defi cient cells and isogenic BRCA2-profi cient controls than for cisplatin ( 30 ). We therefore tested complementation of PARP inhibitor sensitivity for a number of BRCA1 mutants and the BRCA1 wild-type control. Given the unexpected neutral effects of the M1400V, L1407P, and M1411T mutations in the PALB2 interaction domain, we decided to include these variants in this series, as well as the R1699Q and V1736A variants that have recently been shown to confer (intermediate) breast and ovarian cancer risk ( 31, 32 ). To allow direct comparison of results from different assays, we repeated the cisplatin sensitivity and proliferation assays in parallel to the olaparib sensitivity assay. Our results indicate that BRCA1 wild-type and empty vector controls indeed show a larger difference in sensitivity for olaparib than for cisplatin ( Fig.  6 ). However, this increase in dynamic range is accompanied by an increased variation between repeat experiments for BRCA1-profi cient samples.

It should also be noted that, in contrast with the large-scale classifi cation experiments, the cisplatin sensitivity assay conducted in parallel to the PARP inhibitor assay identifi ed signifi cant functional defects for L1407P and V1736A.  DISCUSSION  Over the past few years several functional assays for classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs have been developed. Several of these assays are restricted to functions of the BRCA1 protein that reside in the evolutionarily conserved RING or BRCT domains. Examples include in vitro transactivation assays for BRCT peptides ( 8 ) and measurement of ubiquitin ligase activity for protein fragments encompassing the N-terminal RING domain ( 33 ). Other assays were designed to evaluate the functions of full-length mutant BRCA1 protein, either by monitoring general effects on proliferation or response to DNA damage ( 7 ), or by directly focusing on the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair via HR ( 34 ).  Because BRCA1 VUSs are not restricted to regions encoding the N- or C-terminal domains, and given the observation that interaction between these domains is required for recruitment of BRCA1 to damaged DNA ( 35 ), functional assays for the full-length protein would be ideal. In principle, such assays can be conducted in cell lines derived from BRCA1 - mutated tumors, but there are indications that the outcome of assays for BRCA1 function depends on the cellular context. As absence of BRCA1 leads to loss of cellular viability, it is thought that additional mutations are required for BRCA1- associated tumorigenesis. For example, loss of p53 alleviates the consequences of BRCA1 defi ciency both in vitro and in vivo ( 4 ) and is common in BRCA1-defi cient tumors ( 36, 37 ). Also, depletion of 53BP1 is known to suppress the defects caused by BRCA1 defi ciency ( 5 , 38 , 39 ). Therefore, aberrations in BRCA1-defi cient tumor cells may mask functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs. We reasoned that assays in normal cells that can be depleted from endogenous BRCA1 expression are most likely to reveal functional defects of BRCA1 VUSs.

BAC complementation assays in mouse embryonic stem cells ( 7 , 40 ). However, mutagenesis of large BAC clones by recombineering and functional complementation of cells with these mutant constructs is time-consuming and technically demanding, and therefore cannot be conducted in a high-throughput setting. We therefore set out to develop a cDNA-based functional complementation assay in mouse embryonic stem cells that is easier to control and scale up and more suitable for routine functional classifi cation of BRCA1 sequence variants.  One advantage of BAC transgenics in complementation assays is that genes are expressed at physiologically relevant levels. This is the result of low copy-number integrations and the presence of natural regulatory elements required for proper gene expression. We decided to use RMCE to allow single-copy integration of BRCA1 cDNAs at one specifi c genomic locus. The use of RMCE effectively prevents multiple or partial integrations, concatemers, and position-effect variegation. As a result, all variants are expressed at equal levels. Moreover, transcription of BRCA1 cDNAs from the EF1A gene promoter results in physiologic levels of BRCA1 protein, comparable with those observed in embryonic stem cells stably transfected with a BAC containing the human BRCA1 locus. Indeed, the wild-type human BRCA1 cDNA was able to complement Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells in cellular proliferation, drug sensitivity, and HR assays. Our RMCE strategy uses BRCA1 cDNA constructs in which mutations can be swiftly introduced using SDM, enabling a higher throughput than introduction of mutations via BAC recombineering. In addition, the introduction of BRCA1 cDNAs via RMCE obviates the need to analyze multiple embryonic stem cell clones for correct integration and expression.  As a proof of principle, we used our functional complementation assay to analyze exonic BRCA1 VUSs that were identifi ed in families with HBOC in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as a set of previously analyzed BRCA1 variants. A number of mutations resulted in reduced BRCA1 protein levels, most likely because of structural destabilization. In all cases, this led to diminished capacity for functional complementation. Also, several variants that gave rise to normal BRCA1 protein levels were unable to rescue the proliferation defect and cisplatin sensitivity of Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells. As BRCA1 loss of function mutations are associated with increased cancer risk, variants that score as functionally impaired in our embryonic stem cell assay system may be causally involved in tumor formation. This notion is supported by the fact that seven of eight known pathogenic or neutral control variants in our validation series were correctly classifi ed by the cisplatin sensitivity assay. The pathogenic 5382insC truncation mutation could not be classifi ed because it scored as neutral in one of three transfection series. This was probably due to technical reasons, as the 5382insC mutation did not restore HR activity in Brca1 -defi cient embryonic stem cells, in contrast with R1699Q, which was recently shown to confer intermediate risk of HBOC ( 32 ).  Our assay system yielded ambivalent results for nine other variants: S4F, S308A, S1651P, S1651F, T1691I, V1736A, E1735K, H1746Q, and R1753T. T1691I and E1735K were classifi ed as functionally impaired in only one cisplatin sensitivity test, whereas values from repeat experiments could not be taken into account because of RSE values above 0.1. S4F, S1651P, S1651F, V1736A, H1746Q, and R1753T were differently classifi ed in repeat experiments, which may refl ect technical fl aws or intermediate activity of these variants. Of note, the V1736A mutation was recently identifi ed as a pathogenic variant with hypomorphic activity in DNA repair ( 31 ). Although we did not measure signifi cant HR activity of V1736A in a DR-GFP gene conversion assay, intermediate activity of this variant is supported by the results of the proliferation assays and additional cisplatin sensitivity assays. S1651F showed HR activity similar to wild-type BRCA1 , whereas R1753T was HR-defi cient. S308A is an artifi cial mutation of a BRCA1 phosphorylation site that was able to support proliferation and resistance to DNA damage in an embryonic stem cell-based BAC complementation assay. However, S308A-complemented embryonic stem cells did show increased apoptosis when cultured in embryoid bodies ( 7 ), indicating a partial defect that might explain the ambivalent results for this mutation in our assays.  Our results show that BRCA1 variants should ideally be assayed in triplicate to avoid misclassifi cation. This also applies to BRCA1 VUS that we classifi ed as neutral, most of which were tested only once because in our current study we focused on variants that showed functional impairment. The striking restriction of unambiguously predicted pathogenic mutants to the terminal RING and BRCT domains suggests that some plasticity is allowed for the central domain of BRCA1. However, our dataset is still limited and more experiments are required to gain insight into the function of this domain.  Our cDNA-based system allows for several additional functional assays that have been described previously for BAC transgenic embryonic stem cells ( 7 ). These include assays for defects during in vitro and in vivo embryonic stem cell differentiation but also treatments with other cytotoxic agents. As a proof of principle, we investigated the activity of a number of mutants in the response to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. These included M1400V, L1407, and M1411T, which were previously shown to impair PALB2 binding and have a negative effect on BRCA1 function ( 10 ). Although the differences in sensitivity of BRCA1-defi cient versus BRCA1-profi cient embryonic stem cells are larger for olaparib than for cisplatin, increased variation between repeat experiments allowed us to identify functional defects only for L1407 and not for the other two variants in the PALB2 interaction domain, M1400V and M1411T. However, the R1699Q and V1736A variants, which are known to have hypomorphic activity, clearly showed a defect in the response to olaparib. Interestingly, both mutations are in the BRCT domain, and it has recently been shown that mutation of this domain especially confers sensitivity to PARP inhibition ( 41 ). Together, our results show that PARP inhibitor sensitivity assays may have added value, especially for the classifi cation of BRCA1 VUSs with intermediate phenotypes.  Platinum drugs and PARP inhibitors are selectively toxic to BRCA1-defi cient cells because they target HR defi ciency. Although the role of BRCA1 in HR is thought to be essential for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing accumulation of (oncogenic) mutations, other activities may also contribute to its tumor suppression function.

Nevertheless, we observed a good correlation between the results of the cisplatin sensitivity assay and the results of the DR-GFP HR assay. All BRCA1 variants that failed to restore the cisplatin response in Brca1 -null embryonic stem cells were also defective in catalyzing gene conversion, thereby confi rming our functional classifi cation. It will be interesting to see if this holds true for all BRCA1 variants or whether there are also pathogenic mutations that have no effect on HR.  As with any other in vitro approach, our functional complementation assay system might still fail to identify all pathogenic variants because it does not necessarily recapitulate all aspects of BRCA1 function in vivo . A limitation of our cDNA-based assay is also that it cannot be used to investigate effects on mRNA splicing. Although algorithms have been designed to predict possible splice defects, the consequences of mutations outside of the consensus splice sites especially require functional validation experiments. For this purpose, BAC complementation assays ( 7 ), minigene-based splicing assays, or BRCA1 transcript analysis of patient blood samples ( 19 ) may be instrumental. However, transacting factors also affect splicing, and these may be tissue specifi c ( 42 ). A possible solution would be to determine the presence of BRCA1 splice variants in tumor tissue from BRCA1 VUS carriers and use this information to generate a cDNA construct for analysis of the functional consequences. To evaluate BRCA1 VUSs, there remains a need for multifactorial models that combine results from functional assays and in silico analyses with genetic evidence and other information from mutation carriers. This also includes DNA copy number data from tumors from BRCA1 VUS carriers, as it is known that BRCA1- associated breast tumors show distinct genomic aberrations ( 43, 44 ). Our functional assay system does however provide a robust and easily implementable tool for the functional characterization of large numbers of BRCA1 VUSs within the context of the full-length protein. It is our hope that our assay system will fi nd its way to clinical genetics laboratories where it can be used to aid genetic counseling. Ideally, these tests should be coordinated on an international level and in close collaboration with the ENIGMA consortium.

       "Mutation screening of the breast and ovarian cancer–predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 is becoming an increasingly important part of clinical practice. Classification of rare nontruncating sequence variants in these genes is problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter function sufficiently to predispose cells to cancer development. Using data from the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database of nearly 70,000 full-sequence tests, we assessed the clinical significance of 1,433 sequence variants of unknown significance (VUSs) in the BRCA genes. Three independent measures were employed in the assessment: co-occurrence in trans of a VUS with known deleterious mutations; detailed analysis, by logistic regression, of personal and family history of cancer in VUS-carrying probands; and, in a subset of probands, an analysis of cosegregation with disease in pedigrees. For each of these factors, a likelihood ratio was computed under the hypothesis that the VUSs were equivalent to an “average” deleterious mutation, compared with neutral, with respect to risk. The likelihood ratios derived from each component were combined to provide an overall assessment for each VUS. A total of 133 VUSs had odds of at least 100:1 in favor of neutrality with respect to risk, whereas 43 had odds of at least 20:1 in favor of being deleterious. VUSs with evidence in favor of causality were those that were predicted to affect splicing, fell at positions that are highly conserved among BRCA orthologs, and were more likely to be located in specific domains of the proteins. In addition to their utility for improved genetics counseling of patients and their families, the global assessment reported here will be invaluable for validation of functional assays, structural models, and in silico analyses.Sequence-based testing for BRCA1 (MIM 113705) and BRCA2(MIM 600185) mutations is now widely available through both commercial laboratories and research studies. Whereas thousands of BRCA1 and BRCA2 truncating mutations have been associated with increased risk of cancer in carriers, the contribution of other BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequence variants to cancer risk remains largely undefined. These “variants of unknown significance” (VUSs) are mainly missense mutations but also include a number of intronic variants and inframe deletions and insertions (IFDIs). The open-access online Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) Database, which functions as a repository of sequence alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, contains >1,500 distinct sequence variants that are currently reported as having unknown clinical significance. To date, classification of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 VUSs as cancer predisposing or neutral has proven problematic, because it is not known whether these subtle changes alter the function of the proteins sufficiently to predispose to cancer. Determination of their disease relevance on the basis of population or family studies has also proved difficult, because most of the alleles encoding these mutations are very rare and, in some cases, population specific. Although identified in a minority (5%–10%) of individuals tested clinically, the number of such tests performed annually worldwide means that a large number of women (and their families) are affected by the VUS issue. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that minority ethnic populations are disproportionately affected. VUSs in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes pose significant problems, because patients and physicians do not know whether the VUSs predispose to cancer or are neutral with respect to cancer risk. As a result, carriers of VUSs and their family members cannot take advantage of the risk assessment, prevention, and therapeutic measures that are available to carriers of known deleterious truncating mutations. 1 In addition, carriers of VUSs are sometimes counseled to undergo prophylactic oophorectomy or mastectomy because of the presence of the VUS, but in the absence of any knowledge of the cancer relevance of the VUS. For these reasons, the determination of the clinical relevance of VUSs in BRCA1 and BRCA2 has become an important clinical issue. Although the focus of this article is on BRCA1 and BRCA2, similar concerns and issues are found in virtually all complex, genetically heterogeneous diseases for which genetic testing is performed—for example, colon cancer associated with mutations in mismatch repair genes. 2To address the problem of defining which VUSs are deleterious/disease causing and which are neutral, various types of evidence and classification schemes have been proposed.3; 4 ;  5 These include formal assessment of the cosegregation of the variant with disease in pedigrees,6; 7 ;  8 co-occurrence of the variant in question in trans with a known deleterious mutation, 9 and a number of in silico approaches that evaluate phylogenetic conservation and severity of the amino acid substitution. 10; 11 ;  12 In studies of other genes, evolutionary sequence-conservation analysis involving protein multiple-sequence alignments have been used to show that missense variants (MVs) at highly conserved/invariant residues are more often deleterious, whereas highly variable changes are more likely neutral. 13 ;  14 For BRCA1, Abkevich et al.10 developed a predictive algorithm that combines a measure of cross-species conservation, including nonmammalian BRCA1 sequences, with a measure of the degree of chemical change in amino acids, 15 to identify 50 putative deleterious BRCA1 missense mutations.A number of VUSs have been examined, in terms of their effect on protein, with use of functional assays. Efforts in this area have focused on BRCA1 mutations in the two C-terminal BRCT domains, 16 ;  17 which assess the transcriptional activation activity of the BRCT domains with use of mammalian and yeast-based models, 18; 19 ;  20 and on the E3 ligase activity associated with the N-terminal BARD1-binding domain of BRCA1.21 Examination of BRCA2 function has focused on assays of homology-directed repair and centrosome amplification in response to ectopic expression of full-length, wild-type VUS containing BRCA2 protein.22 Recently, crystal structures of the BRCA1 BRCT and BRCA2 DNA-binding domains have been used to predict that a number of VUSs predispose to cancer, 23; 24 ;  25 but genetic evidence suggests that some of these predictions are incorrect. Although none of the approaches described above have successfully been used to classify the clinical relevance of BRCA1 or BRCA2 VUSs, a number have shown promise in this regard. The development of methods based on functional assays, crystal structure, phylogenetic and sequence analyses, and other approaches has been hampered by the absence of a large number of VUSs that have been proven to be either deleterious or neutral on the basis of direct genetic evidence that can be used in validation of these various assays.In this article, we examine the genetic evidence for or against disease causality for a large number of variants, with use of a large database of tested individuals collected by Myriad Genetic Laboratories. In addition to analysis of co-occurrence of VUSs with established deleterious mutations and the analysis of VUS cosegregation in individual pedigrees, we apply a novel analysis of personal and family cancer history, using data on >70,000 individuals, to assess the clinical significance of 1,433 distinct sequence variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2.MethodsSource of Data and Variants AnalyzedThe data analyzed for this article come from the large database of full-sequence testing for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, performed at Myriad Genetic Laboratories. Since our primary focus was on the analysis of personal and family history, we began with all 70,071 individuals receiving full-sequence tests as of December 2005. To avoid potential confusion over which part of the personal/family history was due to which variant, this data set was reduced by eliminating all individuals who had more than one reported sequence variant (including both VUS and pathogenic mutations), which resulted in a set of 61,270 individuals with at most a single BRCA1 or BRCA2 sequence variant. We then divided the family history data set into several ethnic groups, since we postulated that probands of different ethnic backgrounds are expected to present with different distributions of mutations and different distributions of personal and family histories of cancer. After examining the data set with use of some preliminary logistic regressions to examine heterogeneity as a function of reported ethnicity, we constructed three separate groups that had similar family-history and mutation-prevalence profiles. These groups were: (a) western European, central/eastern European, other/none specified, Native American, and Asian; (b) Ashkenazi Jewish; and (c) Latin American/Caribbean and African American. In the first group, 72% were of European ancestry, 24% did not specify an ethnicity, and 4% were reported as of Asian, Middle Eastern, or Native American origin. Individual probands who reported mixed ancestry between these broad groups (e.g., Western European and Caribbean) were not included in the final data set, leaving 60,529 individual probands for analyses of family history. Table 1 shows the distribution by ethnicity and testing results of these individuals. A total of 1,433 distinct unclassified variants in 4,623 tested probands were identified through sequencing and are the subject of this article.Table 1.Results of Full BRCA Sequence Analysis of 60,529 Tested ProbandsNo. (%) of Subjects with GenotypeEthnic Group\\tWild Type\\tNeutral\\tVUS\\tBRCA1 Deletion\\tBRCA2 DeletionEuropeana\\t41,899 (78.6)\\t1,993 (3.7)\\t3,972 (7.5)\\t3,102 (5.8)\\t2,334 (4.4)Ashkenazi Jewish\\t3,622 (80.6)\\t381 (8.5)\\t258 (5.7)\\t139 (3.1)\\t91 (2.0)African American/Caribbean\\t 1,667 (60.9)\\t398 (14.5)\\t393 (14.3)\\t176 (6.4)\\t104 (3.8) Total\\t47,188 (78.0)\\t2,772 (4.6)\\t4,623 (7.6)\\t3,417 (5.6)\\t2,529 (4.2)aSee the text for the description of ethnicity for this group.Table optionsAs before,3 we assumed that all variants can be classified as deleterious mutations (M) or neutral variants (V). Our aim was to calculate a likelihood ratio (LR) of the formView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onfor each variant, given the available data. These ratios (or Bayes factors) can be combined with prior probabilities to obtain an absolute probability that each variant is deleterious. In this work, we first focused on the data sources that are most straightforwardly quantifiable from pedigree data: co-occurrence with known deleterious mutations, family history, and cosegregation. These three sources of data are independent, and the LR can therefore be derived by multiplying the LRs from the three components. We then used an admixture model to examine the influence of the type of mutation.Co-Occurrence with Known Deleterious MutationsTo include information on the co-occurrence of a VUS in trans phase with a deleterious mutation as evidence against the variant being disease causing, we followed the likelihood-ratio calculation described in our previous work. 3 We assumed that, for BRCA1, compound heterozygotes for two deleterious mutations are vanishingly rare (occur in the testing population with a frequency of 1 in 10,000), given both biological and genetic evidence that homozygotes or compound heterozygotes for deleterious BRCA1 mutations are embryonically lethal, 26 ;  27 whereas, for BRCA2, we assumed that the probability is 1 in 1,000, the increased frequency reflecting the fact that viable compound heterozygotes have been reported as Fanconi anemia, type D1. 28 ;  29 For these analyses, we used an updated data set based on ∼100,000 tests with observed frequencies of BRCA1 and BRCA2 deleterious mutations of 6.6% and 5.0%, respectively. The phase of the VUS with an observed deleterious mutation was determined through examination of haplotypes of common polymorphisms known in other examples of each variant or when the VUS and the deleterious mutation were in the same PCR fragment, as determined by direct examination of the sequence traces. In some cases, phase could not be determined, and we assumed that the first deleterious mutation was in cis phase and that subsequent different deleterious mutations were in trans phase. The LR for deleterious versus neutral is expressed asView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere n is the total number of times the variant was observed, k is the number of those that were in trans with a known deleterious mutation, p1 is the overall frequency of pathogenic mutations in the data set, and p2 is the probability of being a compound heterozygote for two pathogenic mutations (e.g., p1=0.066 and p2=1/10,000).Of the 1,433 VUSs studied here, 476 were observed at least five times, and 248 had at least 10 occurrences. Of the 1,433 variants, 44 were observed to occur with at least one deleterious mutation.Classification by Personal and Family History of Tested ProbandsWe developed likelihood models on the basis of family history,3 which, given the availability of the large Myriad Genetic Laboratories data set, is an extremely powerful tool for classification of VUSs. The method is based on the difference in personal and family-history profiles between individuals found to carry a true deleterious mutation and those with a wild-type BRCA sequence. The rationale is that mutation prevalence is known to be strongly dependent on certain key factors (e.g., disease status of the proband, age at diagnosis, and number and age of relatives with breast cancer [BRCA] or ovarian cancer), so these characteristics should also predict the probability of a new disease-causing missense mutation, whereas that of a neutral mutation should be independent of family history.We suppose that we have a set of probands drawn from a population with a certain distribution of family history. Suppose first that family history is classified into n types. Let pj be the probability that an individual with a mutation has family history type j, whereas qj is the corresponding probability for neutral variants. For a VUS that is deleterious, the predicted distribution of family history should be the same as that for known pathogenic mutations. The LR for a VUS with family history in category j drawn from the same population is thereforeView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onwhere {FH} is the set of all family histories in the study population. In theory, the probabilities pj and qj could be calculated from the proportions of individuals with each category of family history who are found to carry a deleterious mutation. In practice, however, there are large numbers of possible constellations of family history, and the numbers of mutations in some categories would be very small. Instead, we estimated these probabilities by fitting a logistic-regression model. Thus, we fitted a model in which the outcome was the occurrence of a deleterious mutation versus a normal sequence, and summaries of personal and family history were included as covariates.This model then provides predicted probabilities rk that individual k is a mutation carrier, given his or her FH, isrk=P(M|{FH}k)   .Turn MathJax onLet r0 be the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis that the mutation is unrelated to family history or, equivalently, the prior probability of a deleterious mutation in the population. This is estimated by the overall proportion of individuals who have a deleterious mutation (rather than a normal sequence). For example, with use of the data in table 1, for the European group for BRCA1,View the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThenView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onandView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onTherefore, the required LR isView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onthat is, the odds ratio (OR) of the predicted probability that the individual with the given family history is a mutation carrier against the corresponding probability under the null hypothesis. Where there are multiple individuals with the same VUS, the LRs can be multiplied. We note that this formulation implicitly assumes that all pathogenic mutations in the same gene confer identical risks—that is, that there is no allelic heterogeneity.To implement this analysis, the logistic-regression model was fitted separately for each ethnic group and separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2. To construct a predictive model to be applied to the VUS probands, we used a logistic-regression model within each ethnic group, comparing the personal and family histories of individuals with known deleterious sequences versus those with normal sequences. The specific factors used in the prediction were categorized asPersonal history of tested individualBRCA1. None,2. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only, orDiagnosis of BRCA at age3. ⩾60,4. 50–59,5. 40–49,6. 30–39, or7. <30.Ovarian cancer1. None orDiagnosis of ovarian cancer at age2. ⩾60,3. 50–59,4. 40–49, or5. <40.Male BRCA1. Yes or2. No.Bilateral BRCA1. Yes or2. No.andReported family history of tested proband (assessed as twice the number of first-degree relatives with given cancer type plus the number of second-degree relatives with given cancer type) (table 2).Table 2.

The predicted probabilities pk were obtained using the “predict” option in STATA.As a simple validation of the process outline above, we examined the family history ORs for the known deleterious variants. Of the 1,106 distinct deleterious variants examined, 123 had odds of >100:1 in favor of being deleterious, 216 had odds of >10:1, and no known variants were excluded at this same threshold. Although we recognize that these summaries may overstate the model’s out-of-sample predictive ability, since the deleterious variants were used to construct the logistic regressions, they do provide reassurance that, in general, the method is performing as we expected. Further confirmation of this is obtained by looking at the similar calculation for 44 variants already classified as neutral and not used in either the logistic regression or in the subsequent analysis of VUSs. Of these 44 variants, 33 had odds against being deleterious of >100:1, and the other 11 all had odds against being deleterious of a lesser magnitude.Cosegregation of VUSs in PedigreesElsewhere, we developed a general-pedigree likelihood method for evaluating cosegregation of variants with disease in families that can be used to assess disease causality for unclassified sequence variants.6 The pedigree likelihood is evaluated under the hypothesis that the variant under consideration has the same penetrance as the “average” known deleterious mutation, compared with the hypothesis that the variant segregates independent of disease in the pedigree(s) under study.As part of an effort to assess the clinical significance of VUSs, individuals found, through the full-sequence testing by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, to carry a VUS are offered free testing of additional family members on a research basis. These additional individuals can be unaffected or affected with BRCA or ovarian cancer and can be male or female. Typically, only 10% of individual probands with VUS provide such samples, and, in most cases, only one or two samples per family are obtained. The pedigree information available in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories database is somewhat descriptive in nature, and, for this reason, we used a simplified model of BRCA1/2 penetrance, with seven liability classes corresponding to (1) unaffected and aged <20 years (or male), (2) unaffected and aged 21–49 years, (3) unaffected and aged ⩾50 years, (4) affected with BRCA at age <50 years, (5) affected with BRCA at age ⩾50, (6) affected with ovarian cancer at age <50, and (7) affected with ovarian cancer at age ⩾50. For each liability class, penetrance values were taken from the 2003 study of Antoniou et al., 30 by collapsing the incidence rates across the broader categories used in that study. These pedigrees were then analyzed using a modification of the LINKAGE package,31 as described by Thompson et al.,4 to obtain the required LR.Because the analysis of cosegregation relies on the distribution of the additional genotype data in the pedigree, conditional on the pedigree (including the proband) phenotypes, it is statistically independent from the family/personal information. Similarly, the co-occurrence data is independent from the other two sources, since individuals who also have known deleterious mutations are not considered in these analyses. Thus, the three individual LRs can be multiplied to arrive at a combined LR.Evaluation of Heterogeneity by Variant ClassTo estimate the proportion of mutations in the data set that are likely to be clinically significant as a function of location, conservation, class, etc., we performed a heterogeneity analysis analogous to that routinely used in linkage analysis. Specifically, the required likelihood is given byView the MathML sourceTurn MathJax onThis likelihood (in practice, the log likelihood) is then maximized over α, and 95% CIs were constructed by finding those values of 2ln(likelihood) that differed by <3.84 from the maximum value. Hypotheses regarding differences in values of α as a function of partitions of the total variant space are performed using likelihood-ratio tests.The 1,433 variants were subdivided into the following groups:1. Variants that changed the resulting protein—for example, MVs and IFDIs;2. Variants that were extremely likely, on the basis of studies of many genes and experimental data, to affect splicing, defined for our purposes as (a) all IVS±½ or (b) if the last nucleotide of the exon is G and if the first five bases of the subsequent intron are not GTRAG. Note that the latter set includes some missense mutations as well as silent substitutions; mutations that were missense changes as well as splice variants were counted only in the splice variant group.3. Other variants, consisting primarily of intronic variants not located within 2 bp of the intron/exon splice junction, exonic variants likely to affect splicing but not meeting the strict definition above, and also a small number of variants in the 5′ UTRs and truncating variants at the extreme 3′ end of the genes.For the missense/IFDI category, we further subdivided the variants by their location within one of two recognized functional domains of the proteins: the C-terminus region containing the BRCA1 BRCT repeats, defined loosely here as “amino acids 1396–1862,” and the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 2500–3098). We also categorized these variants according to whether the wild-type residue involved in the substitution/deletion was evolutionarily conserved through the pufferfish Tetraodon, using multiple-sequence alignments constructed by S.V.T. 10 and available on the Align GVGD Web site. In the case of three inframe insertions, these were denoted as “conserved” if the alignment across species was stable in the region surrounding the location of the insertion.Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 9.0 (StataCorp). The heterogeneity analysis was performed using the R programming language.ResultsWe first built the logistic-regression model comparing probands found with wild-type BRCA sequence with those with known deleterious mutations, using the factors detailed in the “ Methods” section. As might be expected with the very large sample sizes used in the analysis, the logistic regressions were highly significant with good predictive power; areas under the ROC curve were ∼0.80 for BRCA1 and ∼0.70 for BRCA2. Not surprisingly, the most highly significant predictive factors associated with a deleterious BRCA1 mutation were associated with personal and family history of ovarian cancer, with high ORs for early-onset BRCA as well. For BRCA2, the most important factors were a personal history of male BRCA and personal/family history of early-onset BRCA. Interestingly a strong family history of BRCA diagnosed after age 50 years was associated with an increased probability of having a BRCA2 mutation but a decreased risk of carrying a BRCA1 deleterious mutation. For both genes, there were strong dose-response effects for decreasing age at onset of BRCA (or ovarian cancer) and also for increasing numbers of affected relatives. The details of the parameter estimates are provided in table 2 for the large European sample set; those for the other two ethnic classifications were broadly similar. The ethnicity- and gene-specific logistic-regression equations were then applied to a total of 3,951 family and personal histories of tested probands found to carry a VUS, to obtain log-ORs as described in the “Methods” section. The average number of such scores per variant was 2.76, with a range of 1–77; over half of the studied variants had only a single family history available for study. One hundred eighty-two distinct variants had 5 or more family-history scores; of these, 72 had at least 10 family-history scores. The associated log-odds of causality per variant ranged from −10.6 to 11.2, with a mean of −0.26. Sixteen variants had total family history log10-likelihood–ratio (LLR) scores >2, whereas 55 VUSs had scores <−2, indicating odds of 100:1 for and against the variant being deleterious, respectively, on the basis of the family-history analysis alone.In total, 351 pedigrees of probands with 127 (45 BRCA1; 82 BRCA2) distinct variants were analyzed for cosegregation with disease in families. Odds based on the pedigree data alone ranged from 138:1 in favor of causality based on six pedigrees to >250,000:1 against causality based on analysis of 17 pedigrees. It should be noted that the variants targeted for this analysis were selected on the basis of prior evidence that such analysis could contribute to the likelihood calculation. In the co-occurrence analysis, 121 variants were observed at least once in trans with a known deleterious mutation, and 21 were observed two or more times. The LLRs for this source of information ranged from <−8 (for the variant BRCA1*N723D seen 82 times, of which 4 were in trans with a deleterious mutation) to 1.1 (BRCA1*A1708E, seen 76 times, never with a deleterious mutation). The combined evidence from all three sources ranged from odds of >1011:1 in favor of disease causality to 1012:1 against causality.Figure 1 contains the frequency distribution by gene of the combined log-odds of causality for the 1,433 VUSs. From this figure, we see that, whereas 133 variants could be classified as neutral with odds of >100:1, only 24 variants (18 BRCA1; 6 BRCA2) achieved this level of classification in favor of causality. The vast majority of variants analyzed are relatively uninformative and do not individually provide information ( fig. 1). Figure 2 displays the distribution of the log-odds of causality for missense and IFDIs as a function of whether they are located in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 or the DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. Although 27 of the 30 variants with odds in favor of causality >10:1 are in one of these two domains, it should be noted that 29 variants within these domains have odds in favor of neutrality of >100:1.Frequency histogram of combined LLR for 1,433 sequence VUSs, by gene (BRCA1 or ...Figure 1.

Table 4 lists the odds for the 133 variants that have odds of >100:1 against causality and thus are likely to be of no or little clinical significance on the basis of our observations. For those variants with both family history and cosegregation information, there was a modest but significant correlation between the log-odds scores for these two sources (r=0.32; P<.001).Table

However, there was significant heterogeneity among the three classes of sequence variant (missense/IFDI, splice, and other) (χ2 2 df=109.7; P<.0001); 100% of splice-site mutations were estimated to be deleterious, compared with 12% of missense/IFDI mutations and 26% of other unclassified sequence variants. As in the overall set, no significant differences in the fraction of MVs estimated to be deleterious were observed between BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. A strong association with the position of the mutation was observed with 35% (95% CI 26%–45%) of mutations within BRCT or DBD domains estimated to be deleterious, compared with 0% of mutations outside these domains (χ2 1 df=56.3; P<.0001). There was no significant difference in the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations in the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain (33%) and the BRCA1 BRCT domain (37%). When mutations were classified by conservation among species, 46% (95% CI 32%–60%) of the conserved variants were classified as deleterious, compared with 3% of the nonconserved substitutions (χ2 1 df=59.7; P<.0001). However, here, we did observe marginally statistically significant evidence that a higher proportion of BRCA1 missense substitutions occurring at strongly conserved positions were deleterious compared with those of BRCA2 (64% vs. 35%; P=.013).DiscussionUsing an approach based on three conditionally independent sources of information contained in the Myriad Genetic Laboratories large BRCA testing data set, we evaluated 1,433 sequence variants of unknown clinical significance in the BRCA susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Through this analysis, we were able to classify 93 variants with a threshold of odds of 1,000:1, 157 at 100:1, and 222 with odds of at least 20:1. In each case, the majority (e.g., 133 of 157 for 100:1 threshold) of VUSs classified were found to be of no clinical significance with respect to cancer risk. Although additional BRCA testing data produced by Myriad Genetic Laboratories, as well as similar data potentially available from other testing laboratories, primarily in Europe, could classify additional variants with use of this approach, it is clear that the majority of variants are unlikely to be classified in this manner, which highlights the need for use of other data. However, it should be noted that, because the variants most likely to be classified using our approach are generally the ones with many observations, the number of families who could benefit from our results is relatively large. On the basis of the Myriad database alone and with the assumption of a threshold for causality of 1,000:1 and for neutrality of 100:1, as proposed in Goldgar et al., 3 1,569 probands and their families may now have a more informative test result. Although only 140 of these are associated with a variant classified as a deleterious mutation that can be used in genetics counseling of their families, there is some benefit for the rest in knowing that they are unlikely to carry a clinically significant mutation and that their risk is that conferred by their family history alone.We emphasize that all the methods used in this article are based on the assumption that these variants are either neutral with respect to cancer risks or that they have the same age- and site-specific risks as the average BRCA mutation as estimated by Antoniou et al. 30 If a particular variant were associated with lower penetrance (but still elevated over noncarrier rates), it might provide inconclusive evidence, even given a large amount of available data, and/or there would be conflicts between the different sources of evidence (as well as other such as functional or in silico studies).Although most of the information for classification in this study is derived from the family-history analysis, in several instances, the three sources were needed to achieve a clinically useful threshold. For example, the BRCA1 variant I1766S (see table 3) shows odds in favor of causality of 13:1 from analysis of five family histories, 7.4:1 from cosegregation analysis of a single pedigree, and 1.44:1 on the basis of its observation seven times, never with a deleterious mutation, yielding overall odds of 139:1 in favor of this variant being deleterious compared with neutral. In contrast, the intronic variant BRCA1*IVS19-12G→A shows convincing odds based on six family histories (>30,000:1), but this conflicts with the pedigree cosegregation data (odds of 115:1 against, on the basis of three pedigrees); the overall combined evidence for this variant is 363:1, similar to that for I1766S. The reasons for this anomaly are unclear. It might reflect an unusual structure of families from the population from which this variant derives, or it might reflect some unusual pattern of risks associated with the mutation that are not well handled by these methods. To resolve this discrepancy, it would be helpful to verify the pedigree data and cancer diagnoses from the original provider/genetics counselor. Additionally, although there are no data from sequence homology to help in this analysis, in vitro tests of splicing might also provide data on the pathogenicity of this variant. Of the different approaches, we regard the cosegregation analysis as the most robust, since it relates directly to the disease risk and requires few assumptions. Unfortunately, relatively few variants can be classified by this approach alone. Our results demonstrate that the family-history classification can be very powerful, but it is more susceptible to bias due to population-specific ascertainment, 8 although this bias may be minimized by appropriate stratification into subgroups with different mutation prevalences. This highlights the need for some caution in the use of these predictions, especially when there are discrepancies between the methods.Of the 1,433 variants examined, the overall estimate of the proportion of those that are deleterious was 20%, indicating that perhaps as many as 286 of these variants could be deleterious mutations. As expected, there was good evidence that variants predicted to disrupt consensus splice donors were, as a group, deleterious; in fact, the estimated proportion of deleterious mutations was 1.0, so that there was no evidence of neutral variants under the selection criteria we used. This group accounted for an estimated 30% of all deleterious variants examined in the series. Among variants that resulted in a predicted altered BRCA protein, it was estimated that 12% were deleterious, and our analyses indicated that most (if not all) deleterious variants in this group fall at strongly conserved residues and/or in the recognized domains encompassing the BRCT repeats in BRCA1 and the DNA-binding domain in BRCA2. Note that mutations in the ring-finger domain of BRCA1 have been classified elsewhere as deleterious and thus are not included in this analysis. As a group, almost half of all missense substitutions (and IFDIs) falling at positions that were invariant in our alignments of vertebrate BRCA1 and BRCA2 sequences were estimated to be deleterious; these variants, representing 218 of the 1,433 variants studied, would require odds of causality of 117:1 to have a posterior probability of 0.99 of being deleterious. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that VUSs in nonconserved residues or variants in other parts of the proteins are deleterious, the upper confidence limits for these groups indicate that it is unlikely that there are very many of these, and substantial evidence would be required to achieve a posterior probability of 0.99 for these variants. Although there was some slight evidence that the group of missense substitutions falling at variable residues includes deleterious substitutions, these were typically cases where the cross-species sequence variation was conservative and the substitution falls well outside the evolutionarily tolerated range of variation. Further, if only the 129 variants falling at invariant positions within the two important domains are considered, the proportion of variants that are estimated to be deleterious rises to 0.73 (0.58–0.86). Among the 177 variants that were located in introns but not at consensus splice sites, in potential exonic splice sites, in the 5′ UTR, or at the extreme 3′ ends of the coding sequence, there was some evidence that this group may harbor deleterious variants (estimated proportion 26%), with 9 variants having odds in favor of causality of >10:1.For the variants in this analysis, the estimated proportions in table 5 could be used as prior probabilities to estimate posterior probabilities that each variant is deleterious. On the assumption that a posterior probability of 90% would be required to classify a mutation as “probably deleterious,” missense substitutions (prior probability 0.12) require odds of 66:1 in favor of causality to be classified. Ten variants in BRCA1 and five in BRCA2 could be classified on this basis. The data on species conservation provide a more precise classification, however. On the basis of that data, mutations at invariant residues would require only odds of ∼10:1 to be classified as deleterious—12 variants in BRCA1 and 11 in BRCA2 reach this level. In contrast, mutations at variable residues would require odds of ∼300:1, none of which do so.Although relatively few variants can currently be classified, these data can be combined with data from other sources to provide more-powerful discrimination. These data could include further pedigree cosegregation data, but also data on tumor histopathology, which is highly predictive of BRCA1 mutation status, 32 and data on loss of heterozygosity at the BRCA1 and BRCA2 loci. 33 ;  34 This approach has recently been used for classification of a small number of BRCA1/2 variants. 35; 36 ;  37The association with sequence conservation and mutation position that we have observed will also be useful for classification of new variants not present in this data set. Thus, these data indicate that a novel mutation identified in a high-risk family will have a substantial probability of being deleterious only if it occurs in a conserved domain. Note, however, that the “prior” probabilities given in table 5 refer strictly to the families and variants ascertained in this database, and their application outside this context should be undertaken with a degree of caution.Although many investigators have developed in silico approaches for classification and have used evaluation of sequence changes and some have applied functional data, all of these methods require external validation, and all have suffered from a lack of such validation. The data we generated here could serve as a useful source of validation of such approaches, through repeated sampling of each variant as neutral or deleterious on the basis of its posterior probability of causality and then use of the data to estimate parameters of sensitivity and specificity of other assays.What is the immediate clinical utility of the results from the present analyses? Clearly, variants with odds against causality of >1,000:1 (or even 100:1) could be considered neutral, rare polymorphisms for the purpose of genetics counseling, and the at-risk unaffected family members who carry such variants would be reassured that they are not at high risk of BRCA or ovarian cancer due to BRCA1 or BRCA2, although they could still be at increased risk on the basis of their family history alone. Those who carry 1 of the 10 variants for which the evidence achieves the threshold of 1,000:1, or perhaps the 48 (36 of which are at splice sites) with posterior probabilities >0.99, should logically be offered the same options as carriers of BRCA-truncating mutations. Apart from those variants that meet these thresholds, will it be useful to report intermediate categories of risk, such as “likely deleterious” or “probably neutral,” or should the current odds in favor of or against causality be reported to the provider? These questions will require consideration by specialists in risk communication and other disciplines and, as such, are beyond the scope of this study. Our goal in this effort is to eventually classify, with such information, a large number of variants as either “deleterious” or “neutral” and to incorporate the evidence behind the classification as part of the BIC database, as a centralized resource for clinicians and researchers alike. We feel that, with a systematic approach such as this, the problems of clinical interpretation and patient recommendations caused by these heretofore “uncertain” variants can be minimized.

       "The DNA entry and exit points on the nucleosome core regulate the initial invasion of the nucleosome by factors requiring access to the underlying DNA. Here we describe in vivo consequences of eliminating a single protein–DNA interaction at this position through mutagenesis of histone H3 Lys 42 to alanine. This substitution has a dramatic effect on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptome in both the transcriptional output and landscape of mRNA species produced. We attribute this in part to decreased histone H3 occupancy at transcriptionally active loci, leading to enhanced elongation. Additionally we show that this lysine is methylated in vivo, and genetic studies of methyl-lysine mimics suggest that this modification may be crucial in attenuating gene expression. Interestingly, this site of methylation is unique to Ascomycota, suggesting a recent evolutionary innovation that highlights the evolvability of post-translational modifications of chromatin.  Keywords: evolution, histone methylation, transcription elongation, transcriptional output, yeast Nucleosomes, the octameric histone protein complex wrapped by 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA, are core components of chromatin in eukaryotes. At a molecular level, the nucleosome crystal structure shows that there are 14 DNA–histone interactions within the core particle, positioned at each minor groove (Luger et al. 1997). Twelve of these interactions are mediated by histone fold motifs of all four histone proteins, and the remaining two involve residues in the histone H3 αN helix at the DNA entry and exit points. Although the majority of these interactions are mediated by nonspecific electrostatics between the DNA and protein backbones, important positively charged histone side chains have also been shown to play a role (Luger and Richmond 1998). Recently, it has been shown in vitro that not all histone–DNA interactions within the nucleosome are of equal strength. Using an optical trapping method, Hall et al. (2009) mapped the strongest interactions to three precise locations on the nucleosome core, including the dyad axis, and ±40 bp on either side of this.  The different classes of intranucleosomal interactions illustrate how the cell can tune the stability of the nucleosome by reinforcing or destabilizing these interactions, thus controlling the timing and extent of accessibility of the underlying DNA. Various proteins and complexes are recruited to chromatin to alter nucleosome stability either temporally or spatially throughout the genome, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, histone variant proteins, and enzymes that chemically modify histone amino acid side chains. (for review, see Hartzog er al. 2002; Li et al. 2007; Clapier and Cairns 2009). The question then arises as to which structurally important interactions defining nucleosome stability at a molecular level are targeted by these processes.  First, it is known that modification of histone residues is quite complex. Modification of residues lying both at the N termini of histone proteins and within the globular core perturbs the formation of higher-order chromatin structure by influencing electrostatic interactions, and through interactions with specific information “readers” (Watanabe et al. 2010). Second, it has been suggested that the residues at the dyad axis are targeted by chromatin remodeling enzymes, because introducing histone mutations in this region (so-called “SIN alleles”) facilitated transcription of genes that typically require chromatin remodeling in the absence of the ATP-dependent factors (Kruger et al. 1995; Recht and Osley 1999) and lead to nucleosome instability in vitro (Kurumizaka and Wolffe 1997). Furthermore, residues at/close to the dyad axis in the nucleosome do not tolerate mutagenesis well, as these positions are overrepresented in collections of lethal histone mutations (Dai et al. 2008; Nakanishi et al. 2008). Third, it has been shown that certain mutations in histone H3 resulted in the formation of spurious transcription from intragenic locations (Cheung et al. 2008), suggesting that the role of the wild-type residue may be to prevent nucleosome destabilization at the 3′ end of ORFs. These residues are located close to the dyad axis as well as at the base of the histone H3 αN helix.  In this study, we sought to understand the contribution of the DNA entry and exit points to nucleosome function in vivo and ascertain whether it plays a dynamic role in controlling the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA. In the crystal structure, the DNA at this region is organized exclusively by the histone H3 αN helix, and a single residue, Lys 42, within this helix interacts directly with DNA by inserting its side chain between the two DNA gyres. In spite of the fact that it has been shown that this interaction is comparatively weak within the nucleosome (Hall et al. 2009), we know from in vitro studies that mutating this residue makes purified nucleosomes inherently more mobile (Somers and Owen-Hughes 2009). We studied the H3-K42A mutation, and, although not a lethal substitution in vivo, yeast cells harboring this histone mutant as the sole source of histone H3 grow slowly and display a variety of phenotypes. The most striking observation is vastly increased transcriptional output of H3-K42A-expressing cells. Surprisingly, this residue is a substrate for methylation, and our data support a role for this modification in transcriptional repression. We therefore identified a critical interaction within the nucleosome that is targeted to fine-tune gene expression, and we propose that K42, and possibly its modification, serves as a structural “gatekeeper” of transcription. Remarkably, K42 is a “young” lysine evolutionarily; in most other eukaryotes, this residue is an arginine, suggesting recent evolution of its thus-far unidentified methylation machinery.  Go to: Results Histone H3-K42A mutants are pleiotropic in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Histone H3-K42 is a crucial residue that mediates the sole DNA contact of the nucleosome at the DNA entry and exit positions. (Fig. 1A). In the crystal structure (White et al. 2001), the K42 side chain is positioned in the solvent-exposed space between the two DNA helices. Its ɛ amino group points away from the nucleosome core and forms two hydrogen bonds with the phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 1B). To assess the contribution of these interactions to nucleosome function, we mutated this lysine residue to alanine, eliminating hydrogen bond potential (Fig. 1C), and performed phenotypic analyses.  Figure 1. Figure 1. Histone H3-K42A is a pleiotropic mutation, which disrupts a structurally important nucleosome surface. (A) The crystal structure of the S. cerevisiae nucleosome highlighting histone H3 Lys 42 (orange) positioned at the DNA entry and exit points. The figure ... H3-K42A cells grow almost twice as slowly as wild-type yeast (data not shown). We scored the viability of this mutant under different conditions and found it was sensitive to (1) the DNA-damaging agents hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl-methanesulfonate; (2) benomyl, the microtubule-destabilizing drug; (3) 6-azauracil (6AU), a drug that interferes with transcription; and (4) temperatures >39°C (Fig. 1D). It did not display growth defects in the presence of camptothecin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, or cold temperatures (data not shown). The pleiotropic behavior of H3-K42A indicates that this residue either is directly critical for numerous cellular processes, or its affect on nucleosome structure indirectly influences multiple pathways, possibly by influencing target gene expression. To test this, we analyzed the transcript profile of cells harboring H3-K42A. Strikingly, in these cells, we found that the expression of ∼42% of genes was altered in comparison with wild-type cells, with the majority of these (90%) up-regulated (Fig. 1E). The average fold increase for affected genes was two; the expression of a subset of loci was altered up to 12-fold above wild-type levels. No specific gene classes (based on Gene Ontology [GO] terms) were preferentially perturbed by histone H3-K42A (Supplemental Fig. S1). Additionally, no correlation was observed between chromosome location and transcriptional response to the H3-K42A substitution (data not shown).  We next examined whether these effects were specific to K42A or whether mutating other residues close to this nucleosome location exhibited similar phenotypes. We know that this region is important for faithful mitotic chromosome segregation, serving as a docking site for the recruitment of Sgo1p to pericentromeric regions during mitosis (Luo et al. 2010). This explains why mutations in this region, including K42A, are benomyl-sensitive, which is suppressed by overexpressing SGO1 (data not shown). We found that, although the H3-K42 region mutants do not confer 6AU sensitivity, we did observe increased expression of certain genes in these strains (Supplemental Fig. S2). However, the extent of this effect is nonuniform, and K42A exhibits the most severe transcriptional phenotype. Taken together, these observations highlight the structural importance and functionality of this nucleosome location and suggest that H3-K42 is a key residue within this region in transcriptional regulation.  Histone H3-K42A profoundly alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome  To probe mechanisms underlying the potential role of this nucleosome surface during transcription, we sought to understand the hypertranscription phenotype of H3-K42A. The microarray analysis indicated that H3-K42A does not lead to erroneous derepression of transcription genome-wide, as the majority of genes typically repressed under the conditions tested were unaffected by H3-K42A. Therefore, we hypothesized that H3-K42A influences an active transcription cycle, and thus analyzed the dynamic expression of a single inducible locus: MET16. Our results indicate that the initial appearance of MET16 mRNA under inducing conditions was unaltered in H3-K42A cells, suggesting that regulation of the first round of transcription initiation is unaffected. However, MET16 transcript overaccumulates with time in the mutant cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with a defect in establishing a proper set point for transcription rate or inefficient transcription termination (Fig. 2A). MET16 expression level is not affected under repressive conditions, supporting the hypothesis that the effect of K42A depends on transcriptional activation (Fig. 2A).  Figure 2. Figure 2. Histone H3-K42A alters the S. cerevisiae transcriptome. (A) Kinetics of appearance of MET16 mRNA in cells expressing wild-type (WT) or K42A histone H3, as described in the Materials and Methods. Error bars represent the standard deviation between two ... To gain a higher resolution of the hypertranscription phenotype, we examined the length of RNA species produced in K42A cells transcriptome-wide. We hybridized total RNA extracted from mutant cells to the Affymetrix genomic tiling array, which interrogates the yeast genome at 5-bp resolution. A methodology was employed that identifies stretches of RNA that extend beyond the length of wild-type transcripts as well as differential RNA lengths within an ORF (Poorey et al. 2010). Strikingly, we found that ∼30% of all transcripts analyzed deviated from their expected length in H3-K42A cells (Supplemental Table S1). The majority (61%) of these transcripts also displayed increased abundance in the K42A microarray data set. The distribution of actual base pair length change was broad, ranging from 101 bp to 19,196 bp (median = 902 bp). Altered-length transcripts are categorized relative to the ORF of the affected locus as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, and 3′ extensions. Figure 2B shows that the K42A data set was significantly enriched for both 5′ and 3′ extensions, although truncation events were also detected. Significant overlap was seen between the 5′ and 3′ extension events, indicating that both events occur at the same locus with high frequency in K42A cells (Fig. 2C). A representative example of a transcript length change is shown in Figure 2D for YBR040W, a gene up-regulated 12-fold by H3-K42A. At this single locus, the transcript in K42A cells displayed both 5′ and 3′ extensions. This analysis indicates that H3-K42A drastically alters not only the amplitude, but also the “quality” of the yeast transcriptome.  Hypertranscription phenotype depends on elongation factors  Chromatin negatively impacts many aspects of transcription, and a wide variety of complex mechanisms exist to overcome this obstacle. Based on our analysis of MET16 expression, we hypothesized that histone H3-K42A influences the function of one or more such protein(s) in an event downstream from transcription initiation. We studied transcription component knockouts to probe how K42A elicits its transcriptional effects. We chose 20 nonessential gene mutants known to play roles in the initiation and elongation phases and initially scored their ability to influence K42A 6AU sensitivity. Our results indicate that the K42A 6AU phenotype was specifically suppressed by the deletion of the elongation factors SET2, ELC1, or RCO1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, we found no genetic interactions between K42A and a series of genes involved primarily in transcription initiation, such as SET1, GCN5, GAL11, and BRE1 (data not shown). Table 1 lists all of the genes tested in this analysis.  Table 1. Table 1. Suppression analysis of histone H3-K42A through perturbations of transcription-related complexes Figure 3. Figure 3. Histone H3-K42 is an important residue during transcription elongation. (A) Strains with the indicated genotypes were plated as described in the Materials and Methods to detect transcriptional elongation defects. (B) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis ... As certain elongation factor deletions are themselves sensitive to 6AU—such as dst1Δ and paf1Δ, for example—we sought additional evidence for the ability of elongation factors to suppress K42A-mediated hypertranscription. We employed quantitative RT–PCR to monitor the expression of three specific loci up-regulated by H3-K42A: YBR040W, YNR062C, and YKL221W. We found that deletions of SET2, DST1, RCO1, or PAF1 completely reversed the ability of H3-K42A to increase transcription of these genes (Fig. 3B). These interactions are consistent with the idea that K42A hypertranscription reflects hyperelongation. If we explain the 6AU sensitivity of K42A as the inability of these cells to generate essential transcripts when nucleotide pools are decreased, perhaps a direct consequence of the extent of genome-wide hypertranscription, then mutations that decrease elongation rates will allow those nucleotides to be used more effectively and restore growth in the presence of 6AU. In contrast, although elc1Δ suppressed the 6AU phenotype of K42A, this strain did not alter the expression pattern of the three test genes. It was also noted that ubp8Δ, a gene involved in the transition between transcription initiation and elongation, had a slight but reproducible suppressive effect in both assays tested (Fig. 3B; data not shown).  Since SET2 is the histone methyltransferase for H3-K36, a residue in close proximity to H3-K42, we tested whether substitutions at H3-K36 would also suppress K42A and found that H3-K36A suppressed K42A slow growth and hypertranscription phenotypes as well as its 6AU sensitivity both in cis and in trans (Fig. 3A; data not shown).  These genetic data show a striking pattern: The H3-K42A phenotypes are specifically suppressed by a subset of elongation factor mutants, suggesting that the mode of action of this allele may be to induce hyperelongation or uncontrolled elongation. The altered elongation rate might in turn explain the altered 3′ end formation observed in >1000 different genes. To test this hypothesis, we determined the levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) actively involved in elongation as opposed to initiation by analyzing the phosphorylation status of its C-terminal domain (CTD). Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD is a hallmark of the elongating RNAPII; immunoblot analysis indicated that the levels of this modification were increased in K42A-expressing cells compared with the wild type. In contrast, CTD phosphorylation at Ser 5 is important during transcription initiation; K42A did not affect this modification significantly (Fig. 3C).  Histone H3-K42A alters chromatin structure at actively transcribed genes  Data presented thus far suggest a potential role for H3-K42 in negatively regulating transcription elongation and support the removal of this inhibitory effect by the K42A substitution. Given that nucleosomes harboring a mutation at this site display increased mobility in vitro, we hypothesized that the K42A phenotype may be due to a direct effect on chromatin structure. Figure 2A shows that H3-K42A increases the levels of MET16 expression under inducing conditions specifically, indicating that activated transcription is necessary to reveal the K42A phenotype. Therefore, we hypothesized that K42A-containing nucleosomes give rise to an altered chromatin template that is more permissive to transcription once initiated. We determined the occupancy of histone H3 at genes up-regulated by the H3-K42A mutation by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), as a decrease in nucleosome density across a gene would promote transcription. Additionally, the generation of 5′ truncated transcripts, as seen in K42A cells, has been accounted for previously by the lack of restoration of a repressive chromatin state in the wake of RNAPII elongation (Carrozza et al. 2005; Joshi and Struhl 2005; Keogh et al. 2005). Figure 3D indicates that there is a significant loss of histone H3 at these loci in K42A cells. Interestingly, in two out of the three genes tested, this difference was evident only at the 3′ end of the ORF. There was no detectable difference in H3 occupancy at genes that are unresponsive to K42A; namely, ACT1, inactivated MET16, and an intergenic noncoding locus in K42A cells (data not shown).  During transcription, nucleosomes are continuously disassembled and reassembled by histone chaperones to facilitate the passage of RNAPII along a gene while maintaining a closed state to prevent aberrant initiation (Schwabish and Struhl 2004; Kulaeva et al. 2007). Spt6p is an essential histone chaperone that binds histone H3 and is important for replacing histone H3/H4 tetramers behind RNAPII. Cells expressing a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, display phenotypes very similar to that of H3-K42A at semipermissive conditions with respect to transcription up-regulation, decreased nucleosome density in gene coding regions, intragenic transcription, and temperature sensitivity (Kaplan et al. 2003; Cheung et al. 2008). Based on these similarities, we hypothesized that the phenotypes associated with K42A result from defects in the SPT6 pathway, and, accordingly, we expected no exacerbation of the common phenotypes when both alleles are combined. We integrated the spt6-1004 allele into our histone knockout strain background and observed no enhancement of spt6-1004 temperature sensitivity by H3-K42A. Furthermore, mRNA length changes in spt6-1004 cells were not altered in the presence of K42A and at either permissive or semipermissive temperatures (Supplemental Fig. S4).  Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae.  During the course of this work, our ongoing proteomic effort to identify novel post-translational modifications (PTMs) in the globular core of nucleosomes revealed, to our surprise, that histone H3-K42 can be methylated in yeast. We detected both monomethyl and dimethyl forms of K42 using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry in three independent samples (Fig. 4A).  Figure 4. Figure 4. Histone H3-K42 is dimethylated in S. cerevisiae. (A) Electrospray tandem mass spectrum (MS/MS) of the doubly charged dimethylated peptide: YK(dimet.)PGTVALR, m/z 516.869, recorded using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer in an LC-MS/MS experiment ... Residue 42 is an arginine in all other eukaryotes except Ascomycota (Supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that, if this lysine is indeed modified, the methylation machinery must be newly evolved. With considerable skepticism, we raised an antibody against a K42 dimethyl-containing peptide. With such an antiserum in hand, experiments to probe for this modification in S. cerevisiae by an independent method became possible. The dot blot in Figure 4B indicates the specificity of this antibody in recognizing the dimethyl-modified histone peptide over the unmodified using competition assays with specific and control unmodified peptides. Immunoblot analyses (Fig. 4C) supported the specificity of the antibody and the existence in vivo of dimethylation of H3-K42 (H3-K42me2). These data illustrate that the serum detects its antigen in both purified histones and whole-cell protein extracts from yeast expressing wild-type histone H3, but fails to detect histone H3 from strains harboring mutations at residue 42 or unmodified bacterially expressed yeast histone H3. Additionally, the modified band in the immunoblot could be competed away by addition of either a monomethyl or dimethylated histone peptide, but not trimethyl or unmodified control peptides.  Histone H3-K42 methylation is enriched at the 5′ end of genes  In our efforts to characterize histone H3-K42me2, we undertook ChIP-on-chip analysis using the methyl-specific antibody to probe for the localization of this modification across the yeast genome. Histone H3-K42 dimethylation was significantly enriched at 491 genome locations distributed seemingly randomly across all 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes (at a false discovery rate [FDR] threshold of <0.1). The modification was enriched in intragenic regions (65%); however, a substantial proportion was also located in intergenic regions (35%). Figure 4D shows the distribution of H3-K42me2 averaged genome-wide across all genes, indicating enrichment in the 5′ half of genes.  Establishing a genetic system to probe the possible function of histone H3-K42me2  We next sought in vivo evidence for the functionality of this modification in yeast. The H3-K42A mutation eliminates this modification in cells, and therefore the phenotypes associated with this substitution give us some insight into the effects of losing H3-K42me2. However, alanine is not a conservative substitution and, as stated previously, in addition to preventing K42 methylation, it also eliminates potential K42 hydrogen bonding with DNA. We therefore mutated K42 to arginine to mimic a constitutively nonmethylated form of K42 while maintaining hydrogen-bonding potential. Unfortunately, this allele displayed no detectable phenotypes in any assay tested (Fig. 5A; data not shown). We rationalized that perhaps arginine can act a substrate for methylation at this site, supported by the presence of arginine at this position in all other eukaryotes. However, we were unsuccessful in detecting methylation at this site in cells by mass spectrometry. Therefore, we chose to use K42Q as a surrogate for a demethylated version of K42, as it cannot be methylated but is predicted to retain the H bond to DNA (Supplemental Fig. S6).  Figure 5. Figure 5. Histone H3-K42me2 may play a role in transcription. (A) Strains expressing the indicated histone H3 allele were assayed for their sensitivity to 6AU to detect transcription elongation defects. ppr1Δ acts as a positive control for comparison. ( ... A complementary approach that is widely used to determine the contribution of a PTM in vivo is to generate a mutation at the site that mimics a constitutively modified state. The closest natural mimics to a methylated lysine are leucine and methionine, which represent monomethyl and dimethyl side chains, respectively. Structures of nucleosomes predicted by energy minimization (Guex and Peitsch 1997) harboring these substitutions are illustrated in Supplemental Figure S6. Although the length of the side chains of the substituted amino acids do not extend as far as lysine, their solvent exposure seems unaltered, and it could be argued that the recognition of their functional groups is similar to that of the modified and unmodified native residues. In particular, the solvent-exposed side chain terminal dimethyl of leucine has a contour strikingly similar to that of dimethyl lysine.  Histone H3-K42me2 may regulate transcription  We generated strains that expressed either H3-K42Q, H3-K42L, or H3-K42M as their sole source of histone H3 and monitored their phenotypes. Initially we determined each strains' sensitivity to 6AU, and Figure 5A shows that our data are consistent with the modification status dictating the sensitivity to this drug. Cells expressing the unmodified mimic K42Q behaved like K42A and were sensitive to the drug, whereas cells expressing the modified mimics K42L and K42M were unaffected by 6AU.  To ask whether the effect of K42A on transcription might be related to H3-K42 modification state, we analyzed K42Q and K42L transcript profiles. Histone H3-K42Q altered expression of ∼25% of the genome and, as in K42A-expressing cells, the majority (∼77%) of these genes were up-regulated. K42L, however, had a more modest phenotype, resulting in dysregulation of only 7% of the genome. Strikingly, however, the major effect of K42L was to down-regulate gene expression (Table 2). We next determined the number and identity of target genes common to the three profiling experiments (Fig. 5B). There was high concordance between genes affected by both K42A and K42Q and the direction of change in expression of these genes. One-hundred-thirty-five genes were affected by all three alleles: K42A, K42Q, and K42L. Whereas the direction of change in these genes was concordant in K42A and K42Q, ∼40% of the genes were oppositely regulated by K42L. Additionally, almost all genes common to the K42A and K42L data sets were differentially regulated by each mutation. Collectively, these data support a model in which K42 methylation is a repressive mark for transcription.  Table 2. Table 2. Summary of microarray analysis of the indicated histone H3-K42 mutants A more direct test of this model is to compare the loci that are enriched by K42 methylation, as determined by our ChIP-on-chip experiment, and those genes whose expression was dysregulated by K42 alleles. Consistent with K42 methylation acting to inhibit transcription, we found significant overlap between genomic regions containing this modification and the loci up-regulated by both K42A (P-value = 1.6 × 10−4) and K42Q (P-value = 3.1 × 10−6) substitutions, both of which mimic a lack of K42me2. Consistently, the relatively few genes that showed decreased expression in the presence of K42A or K42Q did not show significant enrichment of H3-K42me2, consistent with these representing secondary effects. Furthermore, we found that loci down-regulated by the constitutively methylated mimic K42L were significantly enriched for nucleosomes containing H3-K42me2 (P-value = 1.3 × 10−4).  Given our knowledge that H3-K42A causes mRNA length changes, we asked whether other K42 alleles displayed a similar effect. Specifically, we determined the ability of K42 mutations to initiate transcription at a site downstream from the natural start site. We used a reporter in which the HIS3 ORF was driven by the intragenic cryptic promoter in the FLO8 gene (Fig. 5C; Cheung et al. 2008) and assayed the ability of K42 mutants to grow in the absence of histidine. Our results indicate that, similar to K42A, the demethylated H3-K42 mimic K42Q was capable of inducing cryptic promoter–HIS3 expression, whereas K42L, the constitutively methylated mimic, was not—consistent with a potential role for H3-K42me2 in preventing erroneous transcription (Fig. 5C).  Components of the PAF1 complex influence histone H3-K42 dimethylation  The transcript-profiling studies of the different K42 alleles suggested that methylation of this site may be important in the regulation of transcription, and our genetic investigations into the K42A allele implied a role for the modification during transcription elongation. To directly test this hypothesis, we determined whether strains with defects in transcription elongation might signal through H3-K42me2 and perturb the abundance of this modification. We quantified the levels of H3-K42me2 in 87 deletion strains that either lacked a known nonessential transcription elongation factor or were known to be sensitive to 6AU (Supplemental Table S2). Strikingly, the only strains that showed any effect on the levels of H3-K42me2 were those lacking a component of the PAF1 elongation complex. ctr9Δ and hpr1Δ showed statistically significant decreases in H3-K42me2 and rtf1Δ displayed a modest defect in this modification. ccr4Δ, paf1Δ, and spt13Δ displayed elevated levels (up to threefold that of wild type) of this methyl mark (Fig. 5D).  Go to: Discussion Comprehensive histone mutagenesis in yeast has shown that the DNA entry/exit point of the nucleosome does not tolerate substitutions. We identified a group of histone H3 residues in this location that influence transcription, the most critical among them being Lys 42. We showed that the integrity of K42 is essential to maintain the correct transcriptional output in a yeast cell, potentially explaining why certain mutations at this site are pleiotropic. This is a novel site of methylation in yeast: We used a K42-methyl-specific antibody in conjunction with a genetic approach to probe the function and biological significance of this modification. Given its nucleosomal location and the results of our studies, we believe that K42, and possibly its methylation, acts as a transcriptional “gatekeeper” by limiting access to nucleosomal DNA during transcriptional elongation.  The histone H3-K42A substitution results in the abundance of many transcripts, as well as substantial effects on the lengths of many mRNAs. Considering how the elongating RNAPII is influenced by many negative factors, not least the chromatin template, and that it is not uncommon for this massive complex to halt, stall, or become completely arrested (for review, see Shilatifard 2004), we believe that chromatin containing K42A is intrinsically less restrictive to the elongating RNAPII protein complex because the “gate is constitutively open,” promoting more efficient elongation. The two most prominent changes in mRNA length that we detected in K42A cells are those that generate 5′ and 3′ extensions, indicating that the effect of K42A-containing nucleosomes extends beyond canonical transcriptional units. The inability of transcription to be terminated may reflect the permissiveness of K42A chromatin to elongating RNAPII. We hypothesize that, once RNAPII is engaged in transcription, the chromatin landscape in K42A cells is sufficient to promote elongation through normal stop signals even in the presence of transcription-terminating factors. In support of this, our data show that, in K42A cells, we detected an increase in elongation-competent RNAPII, as monitored by increased Ser 2 phosphorylation of the CTD. Furthermore, we found that, by deleting positive elongation factors, the hypertranscription phenotype of K42A was suppressed. For example, DST1 is required to re-engage stalled RNAPII (Christie et al. 1994; Kulish, Struhl 2001); by eliminating DST1, we decreased the number of RNAPII complexes that complete transcripts, thereby masking K42A phenotypes. Similar results were seen for mutants of PAF1, an RNAPII-associated protein required to recruit proelongation factors to actively transcribed genes, including Rad6p (Wood et al. 2003), Dot1p (Krogan et al. 2003), and the FACT complex (for review, see Jaehning 2010). Since our tiling array analysis does not assign strand specificity, ambiguity exists when transcripts span multiple loci and, consequently, ∼30% of 5′ extensions could be classified as 3′ extensions of an upstream locus resulting from hyperelongation (Supplemental Fig. S7). Additionally, our data indicate that K42A cells do not induce expression of repressed genes, illustrating that K42A chromatin does not generically promote ectopic recruitment of initiation complexes genome-wide. These data, taken together with the fact that deleting nonessential initiation factors did not alter K42A phenotypes, suggest that aberrant transcription elongation efficiency specifically underlies K42A-mediated transcriptional phenotypes.  What are the mechanisms behind the “open gate” state of nucleosomes in K42A cells? Our ChIP analyses reveal that there is a loss of histone H3 in K42A cells at certain actively transcribed genes, which is more apparent at the 3′ end of the ORF. We also provided genetic evidence suggesting that both K42A and spt6-1004, a Ts− mutation in the histone chaperone Spt6p, feed into the same pathway and are mechanistically similar. This raises the hypothesis that the histone H3-containing K42A mutation may not be redeposited efficiently in the wake of RNAPII elongation. However, this explanation alone is insufficient to account for the greater number of transcripts affected by K42A cells than in spt6-1004. We speculate that the permissiveness of elongation in K42A cells may arise from inefficient redeposition of histone H3 in conjunction with increased mobility of K42A nucleosomes, as evidenced in vitro.  Our discovery that H3-K42 is methylated in yeast corroborates the importance of this nucleosome residue, providing us with a mechanism by which a cell regulates this transcriptional gatekeeper. The contrasting transcript profiles of methyl (K42L) and nonmethyl (K42Q) mimics of K42 provide indirect evidence to support such a mechanism. Furthermore, we saw a direct effect on methylation levels in mutants with a defective Paf1 complex. This suggests that perturbations to elongation, specifically through the Paf1 complex pathway, influence K42me2 abundance, placing this modification in the Paf1 pathway. The exact mechanism underlying the pattern of H3-K42me2 variations in the individual Paf1 complex subunit deletions is likely to be complex, although it is attractive to speculate that the Paf1 complex is necessary for the recruitment of the elusive K42-specific methyltransferase. In support of this notion, deletion of PAF1 leads to both initiation of transcription at intragenic cryptic promoters (Chu et al. 2007) and 3′ extensions of certain mRNAs (Penheiter et al. 2005; Sheldon et al. 2005), similar to H3-K42A.  Residue 42 in histone H3 is arginine in most other braches of eukaryotes, including Basidiomycetes (Supplemental Fig. S6), indicating that the lysine substitution appeared within the last 400 million years, after Ascomycota and Basidiomycota diverged. Therefore, H3-K42me2 is not a conserved modification, and, strikingly, the ability to methylate this residue is a very recent innovation in evolution, possibly through neo- or subfunctionalization of a conserved enzyme. To explore what protein might have evolved such a function, we searched for a K42-specific methyltransferase in yeast. Unfortunately, to date, our efforts have proved futile, as individual deletion of all 62 known annotated methyltransferases in yeast, including all SET domain proteins and Dot1p, failed to abolish H3-K42me2, as detected by immunoblotting (data not shown). From this analysis, we assume that Ascomycetes have co-opted a noncanonical methyltransferase to methylate H3-K42, or, alternatively, redundant enzymes may modify K42.  Although the prevalence of K42me2 histones throughout the genome is limited, as illustrated by our ChIP-on-chip data, this might indicate that there was a selective advantage to yeast in acquiring this novel modification at those particular sites. It is attractive to interpret the K42A and K42Q mutant data as reflecting the loss of H3-K42me2, and that the ability of the cell to regulate the transcriptional output may be the selective pressure driving the evolution of the modification. In support of this idea, there is a correlation between genes affected by nonmethyl mimics K42A and K42Q and those enriched with the modification. Additionally, these alleles permit the production of intragenic transcripts, whereas the methyl-mimic K42L suppresses it. Although it has been shown that additional nucleosome core mutations promote intragenic transcription, our study illustrates how this phenomenon may be regulated within the cell by PTM. One tempting model might be that H3-K43me2 regulates the interaction between Spt6p and histone H3.  To uncover alternative sources of selective pressure promoting histone H3-K42me2 evolution, we took a bioinformatic approach and looked for differences in specific chromatin-related proteins between the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, the latter lacking H3-K42. One potentially relevant candidate is the linker histone, H1, which binds DNA at the nucleosome entry and exit points (Thoma et al. 1979), stabilizing the nucleosome and restricting transcription in most eukaryotes. However, S. cerevisiae and other Ascomycetes species lack a canonical H1 protein. Given that histone H3-K42 is positioned in the same nucleosomal region, and our data suggest a role for H3-K42me in transcriptional inhibition, it is plausible that Ascomycota have evolved this modification to serve the function of canonical histone H1. In support of this, our sequence analysis showed that histone H1 divergence largely conforms to phylogeny; H1 sequences from different Basidiomycetes species are more similar than those from Ascomycetes. Similarly, we found that the fungal distribution of a second protein, HP-1, and, presumably, the histone H3-K9 methylation system that generates the repressive chromatin mark that it recognizes follow a similar pattern. Interestingly, in this example, Ascomycetes species lack any detectable homolog of HP-1. These preliminary findings suggest that the lack of canonical histone H1 and/or H3-K9 methylation in Ascomycota could have driven the evolution of a novel repressive chromatin mark, H3-K42me2. Future experiments will be required to directly test this hypothesis.  If we assume that the lack of conservation of this site among higher eukaryotes implies that K42 methylation is a recent acquisition of Ascomycota, we conclude that its function in attenuating transcriptional output provides an evolutionary advantage to these species. We know that, under certain growth conditions, wild-type yeast actively produce cryptic transcripts that play physiological roles (Ono et al. 2005; Bickel and Morris 2006), and that certain intragenic transcripts can be translated into functional proteins, increasing the complexity of the yeast proteome, perhaps providing the cell with additional capabilities and functions. Given that up to 17% of genes within the yeast genome contain intragenic cryptic initiation sites, regulatory mechanisms must be in place to modulate the extent of this form of pervasive transcription, perhaps limiting it temporally or under certain conditions. Methylation of the gate to the globular core of the nucleosome at histone H3-K42 is one such mechanism.  Go to: Materials and methods Strains and media  Standard laboratory techniques for budding yeast manipulations were used. The previously described yeast strain JPY12 (Park et al. 2002) was the parental strain employed for all genetic manipulations unless otherwise noted. A uracil auxotrophy derivative of JPY12, EMHY510, was generated. EMHY510 used in 6AU growth assay was transformed with the URA3 CEN plasmid pRS316. Deletion strains of JPY12 were made using a PCR product amplified from the appropriate BY4742 strain of the KanMX deletion collection. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct integration of the knockout cassette in JPY12. Supplemental Table S3 contains a complete list of strains generated. The Ts− allele of SPT6, spt6-1004, was integrated in EMHY510 by transformation with the SphI-linearized form of the integrating plasmid pCK125 and selecting on synthetic complete (SC)–Ura. Ura+ transformants were streaked to YPD, replica-plated to 5FOA, and subsequently screened for a Ts− phenotype at 39°C. Colony PCR was used to verify the correct targeting of the Ts− alleles.  All media were supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine. SC medium contained 0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (YNB, Difco), 2% (w/v) glucose, and 2% (w/v) bacto-agar, supplemented with 2% (w/v) “Hopkins mix” amino acids. HU medium was prepared by supplementing SC with 200 mM HU. Benomyl was added to YPD-rich medium at a concentration of 30 μg/mL. 6AU-containing medium was SC–Ura containing 200 μg/mL 6AU.  Plasmids  Plasmids pDM18 (Park et al. 2002) and pEMH7 (Hyland et al. 2005) carrying HHT2 and HHF2 and pJP11 encoding HHT1 and HHF1 were used in this study. pEMH17 was generated whereby the NaeI/SacI fragment from pEMH7 was excised and subcloned into pRS315. Histone H3 mutants were engineered into pEMH7, as described previously (Hyland et al. 2005). Plasmids were sequenced with oligonucleotides JB6505 and JB6504. Plasmid pBS4 harboring histone H3-K36A mutation was obtained from B. Strahl. The integrating plasmid pCK125 harboring spt6-1004 was provided by F. Winston.  Growth assays  Yeast strains used in growth assays were grown overnight in either YPD or selective medium where appropriate. The next day, cultures were diluted to an OD A600 of 0.5, and fivefold serial dilutions were plated on both growth control plates and experimental plates. Plates were photographed after 2 d of incubation at 30°C.  Intragenic transcript detection  The FLO8 intragenic reporter was generated by V. Cheng and F. Winston. The reporter construct (4.5 kb) was amplified from strain VC-377-1B using primers JB11738 and JB11739, and was used to transform EMHY510 harboring pBS4 (H3-K36A). Transformants were selected on YPD + G418 and were screened by colony PCR for the correct integration, generating strain EMHY578. This strain was transformed with pEMH17 harboring histone alleles, and pBS4 was shuffled. Transformants were patched onto YPD + G418, incubated for 2 d at 30°C, replica-plated to SC–His, and further incubated for 2 d at 30°C. A His+ phenotype in this assay reports inappropriate intragenic transcription initiation.  Transcriptional profiling; data acquisition and normalization  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. Ten micrograms of total RNA of two replicate samples was used to create labeled cRNA cocktails, as outlined in the Affymetrix protocol. Fifteen micrograms each of labeled cRNA was hybridized on the Affymetrix GeneChip Yeast 2.0 arrays. Data analysis was conducted on the chips' CEL file probe signal values at the Affymetrix probe pair level using the statistical technique Robust Multiarray Analysis (Irizarry et al. 2003) with the bioconductor package Affy. Contrast normalization was carried out as described in Bolstad et al. (2003) using the following control probes: “Bacillus subtilis,” “Bacteriophage,” “Escherichia coli,” “synthetic insert,” and other non-S. cerevisiae “control” probes, excluding all Schizosaccharomyces pombe and S. cerevisiae “control” probes on the microarray. Between-condition and between-replicate variations were examined with pairwise MvA plots, where the base 2 log ratios (M) between two samples are plotted against their averaged base 2 log signals (A). An empirical Bayes method with lognormal–normal modeling, as implemented in the bioconductor package EBarrays, was used to estimate the posterior probabilities of the differential expression of genes between the sample conditions (Kendziorski et al. 2003; Newton et al. 2001). The criterion of a posterior probability >0.5 was used to produce the differentially expressed gene list. Bioconductor packages are found at http://www.bioconductor.org, and all computations were performed under the R environment (http://www.r-project.org). The raw data were deposited at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GSE13889.  Real-time quantitative PCR  Strains were grown in rich medium supplemented with 0.64 mM adenine and were harvested at log phase. RNA was prepared from these cells and treated with DNase, and 500 ng of this RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Following RNase H digestion, cDNA equivalent to 25 ng of input RNA was added to a real-time PCR reaction using the Applied Biosystems SYBR Green RT–PCR system. Reactions were run in a 96-well plate using the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT fast real-time PCR system. The CT values for expression of gene of interest were compared with that of an internal ACT1 control. The primers used for ACT1 amplification were JB9639 and JB9640 for YBR040W; JB10085 and JB10086 for YNR062C; JB10091 and JB10092 for YKL221W; JB10112 and JB10113 for MCD1; and JB12292 and JB12293.  Analysis of dynamic MET16 transcription  Overnight cultures of the indicated strains were diluted 1:20 in rich medium and grown to log phase. Cells were pelleted at room temperature, washed once in water, and added to either SC–Met or SC prewarmed medium, a procedure that took up to 4 min. Aliquots of cells were taken at regular intervals, added to equal volume of ice-cold 100% ethanol, and centrifuged immediately at 4°C. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice. RNA was extracted from cells and the MET16 transcript was analyzed by quantitative RT–PCR as above using primers JB12026 and JB12027. ACT1 served as the internal control.  Immunoblotting  Whole-cell lysates were prepared from 2.5 A600 units of cells for SDS-PAGE using the alkaline lysis method as described previously (Kushnirov 2000). For histone analyses, lysates were resolved on 4%–20% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of histone H3 (1:1000 dilution) (Abcam, ab1971), and histone H3-K42me-specific (1:500 dilution) followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against rabbit IgGs (Amersham Pharmacia) and chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). Polyclonal anti-H3-K42me antibodies, generated by Upstate Biotechnologies, were raised in rabbits upon exposure to the H3 peptide PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48. Antibodies were affinity-purified from the rabbit serum using PPEMH2 and eluted at pH 1.7. Peptide competition of Western blots was undertaken by incubating the H3-K42me2-specific antibody with 0.5 μg/mL appropriate peptide (PPEMH1, 39-HRYKPGTVAL-48; PPEMH2, 39-HRYKme2PGTVAL-48; PPEMH3, 39-HRYKmePGTVAL-48; and PPEMH4, 39-HRYKme3PGTVAL-48 ) for 1 h at room temperature prior to probing the blot. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of the C terminus of RNAPII was undertaken as described previously (Patturajan et al. 1998).  Histone H3 ChIP  The protocol employed was described previously (Dedon et al. 1991) using the histone H3 C-terminal antibody (Abcam, ab1971). Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantitated using quantitative RT–PCR as outlined in the preceding section. The following primer pairs were used: JB10085 and JB10086 for 3′ YBR040W, JB12360 and JB12361 for 5′ YBR040W, JB12450 and JB12451 for 5′ YBR284, JB10114 and JB10115 for 3′ YBR284, JB12452 and JB12453 for 5′ YNR062C, and JB12454 and JB12455 for 3′ YNR062C.  mRNA length change detection  RNA was extracted from log phase cultures of JPY12 strains expressing histone H3-K42 mutations using the acid phenol method. The analysis of genomic tiling array data was carried out by methods described in Poorey et al. (2010). TAS (Tiling Analysis software version 1.1) was used to analyze the raw array data to generate graph files containing log2 (fold change) or differential signals. Differential signals were calculated using the Hodges-Leman estimator, which is associated with the Wicoxon rank-sum test, over a sliding window of 500 bp for treatment versus control. We applied a 0.3 cutoff to the absolute value of log2 (fold change)—i.e., the differential signal data—to identify differentially expressed segments. By comparing these segments to annotated 5′ and 3′ ends, we identified RNA length changes in mutants relative to control. These changes were categorized as 5′ extensions, 5′ truncations, 3′ truncations, or 5′ extensions. Putative length changes that did not satisfy certain criteria—including minimum overlap with the annotations, minimum length change, and minimum signal difference—were filtered out (Poorey et al. 2010).  GBM is the most common and also the most devastating brain tumor, with a 5-year survival rate below 10%. We present strong evidence that GBM can be subclassified into multiple groups, indistinguishable by histological appearance, but correlating with molecular-genetic factors as well as key clinical variables such as patient age and tumor location. We identified six epigenetic GBM subgroups displaying characteristic global DNA methylation patterns, harboring distinct hotspot mutations, DNA copy-number alterations, and transcriptomic patterns. These findings may guide the identification of innovative subgroup-specific treatments, e.g., targeted epigenetic therapies for H3.3-mutated variants, and improve the design of future clinical trials. Our study enables classification of GBM across the entire age continuum into biologically meaningful subgroups carrying clinical implications.  Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM; World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV), the most common primary brain tumor, carries a universally dismal prognosis in children and adults (Louis et al., 2007). With evidence emerging recently of age-specific molecular and genetic differences, it is now becoming apparent that pediatric GBM is largely biologically distinct from adult GBM. Based on similarities in recurrent genomic aberrations (Bax et al., 2010; McLendon et al., 2008; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010; Schiffman et al., 2010; Zarghooni et al., 2010), it was long thought that pediatric GBMs more closely resembled adult “secondary” GBM, which arise from a preceding lower-grade lesion. However, stepwise transformation from less-malignant gliomas into GBM rarely occurs in children (Broniscer et al., 2007). Furthermore, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations, which are found in up to 98% of adult secondary GBM, are very rare in childhood GBM (<10%) ( Antonelli et al., 2010; Balss et al., 2008; De Carli et al., 2009; Paugh et al., 2010; Pollack et al., 2011; Schiffman et al., 2010; Setty et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009).  We recently identified two recurrent somatic mutations in the H3F3A gene, affecting highly conserved residues of its encoded protein, the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, in one-third of pediatric GBMs ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). Mutations in a protein complex comprised of H3.3 and ATRX/DAXX were detected in 45% of cases, and were shown to be associated with TP53 mutations and alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The H3.3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions at K27 or G34—at or near residues targeted by key post-translational modifications that regulate H3.3’s activity in governing gene expression ( Hyland et al., 2011)—and were shown to be linked to distinct transcriptional profiles (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). Methylation of K27 and K36 is also disrupted by elevated levels of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) resulting from gain-of-function mutations in IDH1 ( Chowdhury et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011), which was previously shown to be associated with a distinct Glioma-CpG-Island Methylator Phenotype (G-CIMP) (Noushmehr et al., 2010).  In the present study, we further investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma across the entire age spectrum, and elucidate the impact of H3F3A mutations on the GBM epigenome.  Results Integrated Molecular Classification of Glioblastoma  We used an integrative approach based on epigenetic, copy-number, expression, and genetic analyses to investigate the heterogeneity of glioblastoma across all age groups. An overview of all GBM samples subjected to various analyses is given in Figure S1A available online.  We investigated a cohort of GBMs from children (n = 59) and adult patients (n = 77) for genome-wide DNA methylation patterns using the Illumina 450k methylation array, and complemented our data with unpublished profiles of 74 adult GBM samples generated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Consortium (McLendon et al., 2008) (Table S1). Consensus clustering using the 8,000 most variant probes across the data set robustly identified six distinct DNA methylation clusters (Figures 1 and S1B). Based on correlations with mutational status, DNA copy-number aberrations, and gene expression signatures, as outlined below, we have labeled these subgroups “IDH,” “K27,” “G34,” “RTK I (PDGFRA),” “Mesenchymal,” and “RTK II (Classic).”  Methylation Profiling Reveals the Existence of Six Epigenetic GBM ... Figure 1.  Methylation Profiling Reveals the Existence of Six Epigenetic GBM Subgroups Heatmap of methylation levels in six GBM subgroups identified by unsupervised k-means consensus clustering, and control samples as indicated. Each row represents a probe; each column represents a sample. The level of DNA methylation (beta-value) is represented with a color scale as depicted. For each sample (n = 210), patient age, subgroup association, mutational status, and cytogenetic aberrations are indicated. See also Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2. Figure options A striking finding of this integrated analysis is that H3F3A K27 and G34 mutations were exclusively distributed to the K27 (18/18) and G34 (18/18) clusters, respectively (p < 0.001; Fisher’s exact test) ( Figure 1). The IDH group contained 88% of IDH1-mutated tumors (23/26) (p < 0.001) and displayed concerted, global hypermethylation ( Figures 1, 2A, and 2B), thereby expanding the previously described link between IDH1 mutation and G-CIMP+ tumors to a pediatric setting (Noushmehr et al., 2010). In contrast, tumors in the G34 cluster specifically showed widespread hypomethylation across the whole genome, and especially in nonpromoter regions, when compared with all other subgroups (Figures 2A and 2B). This suggests the existence of a more global version of a CpG hypomethylator phenotype (CHOP), as proposed for a small number of genes in gastric cancer (Kaneda et al., 2002). More detailed mapping of differentially methylated regions revealed that the hypomethylation observed in H3F3A G34-mutated tumors was particularly prominent at chromosome ends ( Figures 2C and 2D), potentially linking subtelomeric demethylation to alternative lengthening of telomeres, which is most frequently observed in this subgroup (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012).

Figure options Of note, all mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 were mutually exclusive (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1). To further test this observation, we extended the targeted sequencing analysis of H3F3A and IDH1 to include 460 GBM samples from patients covering a broad age range ( Figure S1C; Table S2). Even in this expanded series, no co-occurring mutations in H3F3A and IDH1 were detected (p < 0.001), and the age distribution confirmed reported associations of certain mutations with GBM in children (H3F3A K27), adolescent patients (H3F3A G34), and young adult patients (IDH1) ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2009) (Figure S1C; Table S2). As we have shown, TP53 mutations largely overlap with H3F3A mutations in pediatric GBM ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012), similar to the association of TP53 and IDH1 mutations in adults ( Yan et al., 2009). This observation also holds true in our larger cohort, with a high enrichment of TP53 mutations in the G34 (18/18), IDH (22/24), and K27 (13/18) clusters (p < 0.001) ( Figure 1).  Since pediatric GBMs have been shown to display a distinct spectrum of focal copy-number aberrations (CNAs) compared with their adult counterparts (Bax et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010), we integrated DNA methylation clusters with copy-number data derived from the methylation arrays (Figures 1 and S1D). Interestingly, PDGFRA amplification was significantly more common in the RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster than any other subgroup (11/33; p < 0.001), hence our proposed name for this group. The RTK II “Classic” cluster demonstrated a very high frequency of whole chromosome 7 gain (50/56; p < 0.001) and whole chromosome 10 loss (56/56; p < 0.001), as well as frequent homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (35/56; p < 0.001) and amplification of EGFR (39/56; p < 0.001) ( Figures 1 and S1D)—all hallmark CNAs of adult GBM (Louis et al., 2007), as reflected by the complete absence of pediatric patients in this cluster. Overall, tumors from the IDH, K27, and G34 clusters were mostly devoid of the detected CNAs associated with the other GBM subgroups (amplifications of PDGFRA and EGFR, deletion of CDKN2A, chromosome 7 gain, and chromosome 10 loss) ( Figure 1; Table S1), in keeping with a previously reported finding in G-CIMP+ tumors (Noushmehr et al., 2010).  To additionally place the methylation subgroups proposed here into the context of previous GBM classification systems, we used the gene expression signature described by the TCGA to classify 122 of the above tumors with available transcriptome data into one of four gene expression subtypes: Proneural, Neural, Mesenchymal, and Classical (Verhaak et al., 2010) (Figure 1; Table S1). This further confirmed the prototypic nature of tumors in the RTK II “Classic” cluster, which was clearly enriched for “Classical” expression profiles (p < 0.001). The RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster was highly enriched for “Proneural” expression (p = 0.01), further substantiating the previously reported association of PDGFRA amplification with this expression subtype ( Verhaak et al., 2010). As expected, all tumors in the IDH cluster displayed “Proneural” expression patterns. Interestingly, the K27 cluster also showed a clear enrichment of tumors with a “Proneural” signature (p < 0.01), indicating that this expression subtype can be divided into subgroups harboring distinct genomic aberrations based on methylation profiling and targeted gene sequencing. “Mesenchymal” gene expression was mostly restricted to one methylation subgroup (p < 0.001), that showed a much lower incidence of typical GBM-related CNAs, generally fewer copy-number changes, and no characteristic point mutations. We therefore termed this methylation cluster, which displayed the largest similarity with normal brain methylation patterns, “Mesenchymal.” Copy-number aberrations in these samples were, however, observed at a similar amplitude as in other cases, indicating an absence of excess stromal contamination.  Our finding of six GBM methylation clusters is different from a TCGA study using Illumina 27k arrays, which identified three methylation clusters in an adult GBM cohort (Noushmehr et al., 2010). Applying their signature to our data set, however, showed that two clusters (G-CIMP+ and Cluster #3) mapped almost exactly to two of our subgroups (IDH and RTK II “Classic,”, respectively, p < 0.001) (Figure 1). By adding pediatric cases to the study cohort, we demonstrate that TCGA methylation Cluster #2 can be further divided into four biologically distinct subgroups, defined by a clear enrichment for mutations (K27, G34), CNAs (PDGFRA), and/or gene expression signatures (Mesenchymal). The same DNA methylation clusters were apparent when restricting our analyses to the pediatric population, with the exception of the RTK II “Classic” cluster, which is not represented in the pediatric population (Figure S1E). Notably, by analyzing tumors from patients spanning a broad age spectrum, we further observed a clear age-dependent increase in overall DNA methylation levels (Figure S2A), even after adjusting our analysis to exclude tumors with age-related mutations in IDH1 or H3F3A ( Figure S2B).  GBM Subgroups Show Correlations with Clinicopathological Variables  The DNA methylation clusters described here were closely associated with specific age groups, pointing toward the biological diversity of epigenetic GBM subgroups (Figure 1). While the K27 cluster predominantly consisted of childhood patients (median age 10.5 years, range 5–23 years), patients in the G34 cluster were found mostly around the threshold between the adolescent and adult populations (median age 18 years, range 9–42 years), as previously suggested (Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). The RTK I “PDGFRA” cluster also harbored a proportion of pediatric patients (median age 36 years, range 8–74 years), in line with reports of PDGFRA CNAs being more prevalent in childhood high-grade gliomas ( Bax et al., 2010; Paugh et al., 2010; Qu et al., 2010). The Mesenchymal cluster displayed a widespread age distribution (median age 47, range 2–85 years). The IDH and RTK II “Classic” clusters were mostly comprised of younger adult (median age 40 years, range 13–71 years) and older adult (median age 58, range 36–81 years) patients, respectively, reflecting the established differences in patient age between IDH1-mutated/G-CIMP+ and IDH1 WT adult GBM ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Yan et al., 2009).  The epigenetic GBM subgroups identified here also showed mutation-specific patterns of tumor location in the central nervous system (Figure 3A). While K27-mutated tumors were predominantly seen in midline locations, e.g., thalamus, pons, and the spinal cord (21/25 cases with available data), tumors from all other subgroups almost exclusively arose in the cerebral hemispheres (86/92, p < 0.001). To further investigate this association of mutation type and location, we investigated the transcriptomic profiles of H3F3A-mutated samples (n = 13). Gene signatures characteristic for K27 and G34 mutant GBMs were applied to a published series of 1,340 transcriptomic profiles representing multiple regions of the developing and adult human brain ( Kang et al., 2011; Figure S3). The G34 mutant signature appeared to be most strongly expressed in early embryonic regions and early- to mid-fetal stages of neocortex and striatum development. In contrast, the K27 signature most closely matched with mid- to late-fetal stages of striatum and thalamus development. Thus, G34 and K27 mutant GBMs seem to show expression patterns of early developmental stages correlating with their subsequent tumor location, possibly indicating different cellular origins and/or time of tumor initiation for these two subgroups.  Epigenetic Subgroups of GBM Correlate with Distinct Clinical Characteristics(A) ... Figure 3.

(B and C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves for GBM subgroups defined by methylation profiling (B), and mutation analysis (C). The p values were computed by log rank tests between subgroups. See also Figure S3. Figure options Correlating our proposed methylation clusters with patient survival indicated differences between mutation-defined subgroups, but this was somewhat restricted by the low number of patients with available survival data in each subgroup (Figure 3B). We therefore enlarged our survival analysis to include all tumors with known H3F3A and IDH1 mutation status ( Figure 3C). As expected, patients with IDH1 mutant tumors had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) than patients with H3F3A and IDH1 WT tumors (p < 0.001) ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Parsons et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2009). Notably, G34 mutant GBM patients also showed a trend toward a better OS than WT tumor patients, with marginal statistical significance (p = 0.05). In contrast, patients with K27 mutations tended toward an even shorter OS than patients with WT tumors, although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.12). Comparing the two H3F3A mutations, patients harboring G34-mutated tumors clearly had a longer OS than patients with tumors carrying the K27 mutation (p < 0.01). While this association may be partly linked to G34-mutated tumors being more accessible to surgery than the midline K27-mutated tumors, the better prognosis of G34 versus K27 was independent of location for those cases where both mutation type and tumor site information were available (p = 0.02; HR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.05–0.77; Cox proportional hazards model).  Integrating Methylome and Transcriptome Data Identifies Marker Genes of GBM Subgroups  A combined analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression data was used to identify subgroup-specific differentially regulated genes (Figures 4A–4C and S4A–4C; Table S3). This analysis revealed Oligodendrocyte Lineage Genes 1 and 2 (OLIG1 and OLIG2) and the neural development gene FOXG1 as top candidates for further analysis in H3F3A-mutated GBMs ( Figure 4A–4C). DNA hypermethylation across the OLIG1 and OLIG2 loci occurred exclusively in G34-mutated tumors, which concurrently displayed significantly lower OLIG1 and OLIG2 gene expression ( Figure 4D–4F). Interestingly, this pattern closely mimics that of embryonic stem cells, where epigenetic inactivation of OLIG1 and OLIG2 has been proposed as a mechanism to prevent neural lineage commitment (Meissner et al., 2008). Expression of FOXG1 was significantly lower in K27-mutated tumors than in all other subgroups, accompanied by higher levels of promoter methylation ( Figures S4A, S4D, and S4E). This comparative analysis also further supported our suggestion of a CHOP-like phenotype in G34 tumors, as most of the differentially methylated genes were found to be hypomethylated (1653/1946, 85%, Figure S4B) in this subgroup, in contrast to the hypermethylator G-CIMP pattern observed in the IDH subgroup (Figure S4C). Hypermethylation and concurrent downregulation of TP73 antisense RNA 1 (TP73-AS1) was identified as a unique characteristic of this IDH/G-CIMP+ cluster (Figures S4D and S4F). Interestingly, inactivation of this gene by promoter methylation has been reported as a common mechanism in a high proportion of oligodendrogliomas, 80% of which are also known to harbor IDH1 mutations ( Pang et al., 2010).

See also Figure S4 and Table S3. Figure options Immunohistochemical Analysis Correctly Subclassifies Mutation-Defined GBM Subgroups  In an attempt to subgroup GBM samples based on differential protein expression—a method which is likely to be more suitable for possible clinical application—we used commercially available antibodies against OLIG2, FOXG1, and mutated IDH1 (R132H) to stain a tissue-microarray (TMA) with cores from 143 pediatric GBMs, and classified tumors according to their protein expression patterns (Figures 5A and 5B; Table S4). The resulting fractions of tumors with predicted mutations in IDH1 (IDH1R132H, n = 6) and H3F3A (OLIG2+/FOXG1− for K27, n = 37, and OLIG2−/FOXG1+ for G34, n = 21) were consistent with the frequency of each mutation in the pediatric population as detected by targeted gene sequencing (Figure S1C). Our approach correctly classified GBMs with known H3F3A and IDH1 mutation status, and revealed a frequent association between OLIG2−/FOXG1+ tumors (assumed to be G34-mutated), loss of ATRX protein expression, and an ALT phenotype (Figures 5B–D), as previously reported for H3F3A G34-mutated tumors ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). The putative H3F3A mutant groups also did not overlap with tumors harboring IDH1 (R132H) mutations, and only one case with EGFR amplification and homozygous CDKN2A deletion was detected therein ( Figure S5A). The correlation with clinicopathological variables, such as tumor location and patient survival, also reflected our findings from the array-based analysis (Figures S5B and S5C). Of note, rare tumors represented on the TMA occurring in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord were almost always found in the OLIG2+/FOXG1− subgroup (and therefore predicted to harbor the H3F3A K27 mutation), further strengthening our hypothesis of the H3F3A K27 mutation as a unifying characteristic of midline GBM.

Figure options Discussion We have identified six biological subgroups of GBM based on global DNA methylation patterns, which correlate with specific molecular-genetic alterations and key clinical parameters. Our findings suggest that at least 30%–40% of pediatric/young adult GBMs are likely characterized by disrupted epigenetic regulatory mechanisms, associated with recurrent and mutually exclusive mutations in either H3F3A or IDH1, and aberrant DNA methylation patterns. Placing these subgroups into the context of previous molecular GBM classification schemes described by the TCGA ( Noushmehr et al., 2010; Verhaak et al., 2010) revealed a clear correlation with DNA methylation clusters and a corresponding enrichment for previously established expression signatures in different epigenetic subgroups. We have also demonstrated that our proposed classification can refine that described by the TCGA for adult GBM, to give a stratification system that is applicable across all ages, and defines additional biologically meaningful subgroups. A simplified graphical summary of the key molecular and biological characteristics of the GBM subgroups as identified by our integrated classification strategy is given in Figure 6.  Graphical Summary of Key Molecular and Biological Characteristics of GBM ... Figure 6.  Graphical Summary of Key Molecular and Biological Characteristics of GBM Subgroups Simplified schematic representation of key genetic and epigenetic findings in six GBM subgroups as identified by methylation profiling and correlations with clinical patient data. Figure options We and others have recently described a high frequency of H3F3A K27 mutations in thalamic GBMs and in diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), suggesting that the latter likely represent an anatomically-defined subset of K27 mutant GBM ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012; Schwartzentruber et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2012). We now extend this observation to a larger subgroup of GBM, characterized by the K27M mutation, which almost exclusively occurs in midline locations, including rare tumors in the basal ganglia and the spinal cord. This is in line with a recent study by Puget et al. (2012) in which gene expression patterns of brainstem gliomas were found to resemble midline/thalamic tumors, indicating a closely related origin. The K27 subgroup also displays markedly lower expression of the ventral telencephalic marker FOXG1 than other subgroups. Conversely, non-K27 tumors were restricted to hemispheric locations, further underlining the biological divergence of epigenetic GBM subgroups. While recurrent focal amplification of PDGFRA has been suggested as a key oncogenic event in pediatric DIPGs in some studies ( Paugh et al., 2011; Puget et al., 2012; Zarghooni et al., 2010), midline-associated tumors in the K27 or OLIG2+/FOXG1− subgroups (including ten brainstem gliomas with known PDGFRA copy-number status) lacked this common feature in our series. PDGFRA amplification was, however, enriched in a subgroup of supratentorial hemispheric GBMs. In part, this discrepancy may be explained by the use of autopsy (and therefore post radio/chemotherapy) material in previous study cohorts of DIPGs, which might have been confounded by the higher incidence of PDGFRA amplifications observed in radiation-induced gliomas ( Paugh et al., 2010). Nevertheless, amplifications of PDGFRA have also been detected in small numbers of pretreatment samples ( Paugh et al., 2011; Puget et al., 2012; Zarghooni et al., 2010), and post-treatment samples were not found to show increased widespread genomic instability (Paugh et al., 2011). This particularly clinically challenging subset of tumors clearly warrants further investigation, underlining the importance of routine stereotactic biopsy of DIPGs at the time of primary diagnosis.  OLIG2 has previously been reported as a universal marker for diffuse gliomas (Ligon et al., 2004), and OLIG2-positive progenitor-like cells of the subventricular zone have been suggested as potential glioma-initiating cells (Wang et al., 2009). There is also evidence that OLIG2-mediated modification of p53 function is required for complete inactivation of the latter in malignant gliomas, which typically show indirect loss of p53 activity through MDM2 amplification or p14ARF deletion (Mehta et al., 2011). Here, we describe a distinct subgroup of GBM, harboring the H3F3A G34 mutation, in which OLIG1 and OLIG2 protein expression is absent. Given the ∼100% mutation frequency of TP53 in this subgroup, this may indicate a different pathogenesis of G34-mutated GBM, in which direct inactivation of p53 is required rather than via an OLIG2-dependent mechanism.  The previously reported association of H3F3A mutations, particular the G34 mutation, with loss of ATRX and ALT ( Schwartzentruber et al., 2012) is further expanded upon here. Interestingly, the global CHOP that we observed in G34 mutants was particularly pronounced in subtelomeric regions, suggesting a possible mechanistic link with ALT in these tumors (Gonzalo et al., 2006). Whether this is a more general phenotype that can be observed in clinically and etiologically distinct subgroups of other human cancers, remains to be investigated.  The close link between H3F3A mutation type, tumor location, and differential expression of key neuronal lineage markers leads us to speculate that there may be differences in the cell of origin and/or the time of tumor development between these GBM subgroups. Although supported by the differential expression of mutant-specific gene signatures at different stages of human brain development, this remains to be formally shown. Also requiring further validation in larger, prospective cohorts is the association of the G34 mutation with better overall survival compared with H3F3A and IDH1 WT tumors, and that of K27 mutation with potentially poorer prognosis, as observed in our series and a recent cohort of pediatric DIPGs ( Khuong-Quang et al., 2012).  Given the location of the H3F3A mutations at or near critical regulatory histone residues, and their distinct methylation profiles, we consider it likely that the H3.3 mutations are directly involved in producing widespread aberrant DNA methylation and deregulation of gene expression. This has recently been shown for IDH1 mutations, which alone are sufficient to induce the global epigenetic reprogramming of the G-CIMP phenotype in normal astrocytes ( Turcan et al., 2012). Overproduction of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH1-mutated cells inhibits the TET family of 5-methlycytosine hydroxylases and H3K27-specific demethylases. This is thought to lead to decreased 5-hydroxylmethycytosine and increased H3K27 methylation ( Xu et al., 2011), resulting in aberrant DNA and histone methylation, and a block to differentiation (Christensen et al., 2011; Dang et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2012).  Seminal studies have shown that DNA methylation patterns are tightly linked to histone 3 lysine K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) patterns (Brinkman et al., 2012; Statham et al., 2012), and in high-CpG-density promoters, loss of H3K4me3 and retention of H3K4me2 or H3K27me3 is correlated with an increase in DNA methylation (Meissner et al., 2008). Therefore, mutations affecting H3K27 methylation are likely to affect DNA methylation. In addition, mutations in ATRX have been shown to give rise to changes in the patterns of DNA methylation of several highly repeated sequences, which further supports the link between chromatin remodeling machinery and DNA methylation (Gibbons et al., 2000). Based on our current knowledge, the incorporation of H3.3 variants into the genome, and the subsequent effects on gene regulation, involve the H3.3 chaperone complex (including ATRX and DAXX) in a replication independent manner (Drané et al., 2010; Goldberg et al., 2010) but other factors also likely play a role. The exact mechanism by which the H3F3A mutations might be inducing epigenetic reprogramming requires further elucidation.  In conclusion, this study describes a number of findings that enhance our understanding of the heterogeneity of GBM, as well as shedding light on potential cellular origins and oncogenic pathways leading to gliomagenesis. We have identified potential prognostic biomarkers, which may be further exploited for molecular diagnostic purposes, and also provided a focus for future work at a basic and translational/targeted therapeutic level, particularly in a pediatric and young adult setting.  Experimental Procedures Patients and Tumor Samples  Primary tumor samples for methylation (n = 136; Table S1), mutation (n = 460; Table S2), and gene expression (n = 69) analysis and all clinical data were collected at the DKFZ (Heidelberg, Germany) and at McGill University (Montreal, Canada). Paraffin-embedded samples (n = 143; Table S4) for TMA analysis were collected from the Burdenko Neurosurgical Institute (Moscow, Russia) and from the Department of Neuropathology, University of Würzburg (Germany). Patient clinical details can be found in Table S1 for the methylation analysis data set and in Table S4 for the TMA cohort. All of the tumors were banked at the time of primary diagnosis between 1994 and 2011 in accordance with research ethics board approval from the respective institutes. Informed consent was obtained from all patients included in this study. An overview of all samples included in different data collections is given in Figure S1A. All of the samples were independently reviewed by senior pediatric neuropathologists (S.A. and A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Detailed information about samples provided by TCGA can be found elsewhere (http://cancergenome.nih.gov).  DNA Methylation Profiling  For genome-wide assessment of DNA methylation GBM samples (n = 136) and controls (n = 10; four fetal and two adult samples of non-neoplastic cerebellum; two samples of Whole-Genome Amplified DNA (unmethylated control; two samples of M.SssI-treated DNA [100% methylated control]) were arrayed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip according to the manufacturer’s instructions at the DKFZ. Methylation data of additional adult glioblastoma samples (n = 74) were obtained from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov; available data from TCGA batches 79 and 111).  The following filtering criteria were applied: Removal of probes targeting the X and Y chromosomes (n = 11,551), removal of probes containing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (dbSNP132 Common) within five base pairs of and including the targeted CpG-site (n = 24,536), and probes not mapping uniquely to the human reference genome (hg19) allowing for one mismatch (n = 9,993). In total, 438,370 probes were kept for analysis.  For a subset of differentially methylated genes from the 450k array, MassARRAY technology (Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to validate our results, allowing us to compare DNA methylation levels at 29 individual CpG-sites investigated by both techniques. DNA methylation measurements of those 29 CpG dinucleotides were highly correlated (median Pearson’s correlation: r = 0.96; range: 0.71–1.00).  Gene Expression Profiling  Glioblastoma samples for which RNA of sufficient quantity and quality was available (n = 69) were analyzed on the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array at the Microarray Department of the University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Sample library preparation, hybridization, and quality control were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Expression data were normalized using the MAS5.0 algorithm of the GCOS program (Affymetrix Inc). Gene expression data of additional adult glioblastoma samples (n = 74) were obtained from the TCGA website (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov; available data from TCGA batches 79 and 111). Predictive analysis of microarrays was used to assign TCGA methylation and gene expression subgroups to each of the samples in the present study.  Detection of CNAs  Copy-number aberrations were detected from the 450k Infinium methylation array in a custom approach using the sum of both methylated and unmethylated signals (Figure S1D). For the detection of EGFR and PDGFRA high-level amplifications, homozygous CDKN2A deletions, and CNAs affecting chromosomes 7 and 10 (as depicted in Figure 1), automatic scoring was verified by manual curation of the respective loci for each individual profile, and compared with results obtained from SNP profiling and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis where available. The three methodologies showed very high concordance.  Statistical Analysis and Measurement of Differential DNA Methylation and Gene Expression  For unsupervised consensus clustering we used the 8,000 most variable methylated probes (by standard deviation) across the data set (R package: clusterCons) (Monti et al., 2003; Wilkerson and Hayes, 2010). The consensus matrix was calculated using the k-means algorithm (10 random starting sets, maximum of 1,000 iterations) on a fraction of probes (0.8) in 1,000 iterations. The significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) method was used to identify genes that are differentially methylated or differentially expressed between subgroups. Correction for multiple testing was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Genes were considered significantly differentially methylated/expressed between two subgroups when displaying an adjusted p value < 0.01 and a methylation difference of 0.2 or a 2-fold change in expression.  Statistical Analysis of Clinical and Molecular Data  Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate the survival time of different GBM subgroups and a log rank test was used to test for differences of more than one survival curve. Comparisons of binary and categorical patient characteristics between subgroups were performed by the use of a two-sided Fisher’s exact test. An unpaired t test was used to test for differences between the mean values for continuous variables in GBM subgroups.  Immunohistochemistry and FISH  Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections from all 143 paraffin blocks were prepared to define representative tumor regions for inclusion in the TMA. Antibodies against the following antigens were applied: OLIG2 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA; AB9610; dilution 1:250), FOXG1 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab18259; dilution 1:50), ATRX (Sigma, HPA001906; dilution 1:750), and mutated IDH1 (R132H; (Capper et al., 2010; dianova, DIA H09). Multicolor interphase FISH analysis for PDGFRA, EGFR, and CDKN2A was performed as described ( Pfister et al., 2009). Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (Heaphy et al., 2011) using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark).  Genomic Sequencing  Targeted sequencing of H3F3A (first coding exon), IDH1 (exon 4), and TP53 (all exons) was performed by QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany) in both forward and reverse directions using purified PCR products. PCR procedures were as previously described ( Pfaff et al., 2010). Primer sequences are available upon request. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumour in adults and children. However, DNA copy number and gene expression signatures indicate differences between adult and paediatric cases1, 2, 3, 4. To explore the genetic events underlying this distinction, we sequenced the exomes of 48 paediatric GBM samples. Somatic mutations in the H3.3-ATRX-DAXX chromatin remodelling pathway were identified in 44% of tumours (21/48). Recurrent mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone 3 variant H3.3, were observed in 31% of tumours, and led to amino acid substitutions at two critical positions within the histone tail (K27M, G34R/G34V) involved in key regulatory post-translational modifications. Mutations in ATRX (α-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked)5 and DAXX (death-domain associated protein), encoding two subunits of a chromatin remodelling complex required for H3.3 incorporation at pericentric heterochromatin and telomeres6, 7, were identified in 31% of samples overall, and in 100% of tumours harbouring a G34R or G34V H3.3 mutation. Somatic TP53 mutations were identified in 54% of all cases, and in 86% of samples with H3F3A and/or ATRX mutations. Screening of a large cohort of gliomas of various grades and histologies (n = 784) showed H3F3A mutations to be specific to GBM and highly prevalent in children and young adults. Furthermore, the presence of H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations was strongly associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres and specific gene expression profiles. This is, to our knowledge, the first report to highlight recurrent mutations in a regulatory histone in humans, and our data suggest that defects of the chromatin architecture underlie paediatric and young adult GBM pathogenesis.

Figure 3 right Main Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Brain tumours are currently the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity in children. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumour and the first cancer to be comprehensively profiled by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Whereas GBM is less common in the paediatric setting than in adults, affected children show dismal outcomes similar to adult patients, and the vast majority will die within a few years of diagnosis despite aggressive therapeutic approaches. Tumours arise de novo (primary GBM) and are morphologically indistinguishable from their adult counterparts. A number of comprehensive studies have identified transcriptome-based subgroups and indicator mutations in adult GBM, and have thus enabled its molecular sub-classification8, 9, 10, 11. In contrast, although we and others have demonstrated the presence of distinct molecular subsets of childhood GBM and described different genetic alterations compared to adult cases, the paediatric disease remains understudied1, 2, 3, 4, 12. There is currently insufficient information to improve disease management, and because conventional treatments universally fail, there is a crucial need to identify relevant targets for the design of new therapeutic agents.  To decipher the molecular pathogenesis of paediatric GBM, we undertook a comprehensive mutation analysis in protein-coding genes by performing whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 48 well-characterized paediatric GBMs, including 6 patients for whom we had matched non-tumour (germline) DNA. Samples from the tumour core containing more than 90% neoplastic tissue were collected from patients aged between 3 and 20 years (Supplementary Table 1). Coding regions of the genome were enriched by capture with the Illumina TruSeq kit and sequenced with 100-base-pairs paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform (Supplementary Methods). The median coverage of each base in the targeted regions was 61-fold, and 91% of the bases were represented by at least 10 reads (Supplementary Table 2). We identified 87 somatic mutations in 80 genes among the 6 tumours for which we had matched constitutive DNA. The mutation count per tumour ranged from 3 to 31, with a mean of 15 (Supplementary Table 3). This is much lower than the rate observed using Sanger sequencing in other solid tumours including adult GBM11, but somewhat higher than in another paediatric brain tumour, medulloblastoma13 (Supplementary Table 4). Relevant mutations (as defined below) were validated by Sanger sequencing.  Initially, we focused on the distribution of somatic, non-silent protein-coding mutations in the six tumours with matched germline DNA. Four samples had recurrent heterozygous mutations in H3F3A, which encodes the replication-independent histone variant H3.3. Both mutations were single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), in two samples changing lysine 27 to methionine (K27M), and in two samples changing glycine 34 to arginine (G34R) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). These mutations are particularly interesting because histone genes are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes (Fig. 1b), and to our knowledge no human disorders have specifically been associated with mutations in histones, including H3.3. Both mutations are at or very near positions in the amino-terminal tail of the protein that undergo important post-translational modifications associated with either transcriptional repression (K27) or activation (K36) (Fig. 1b). All four samples additionally harboured mutations in ATRX, which encodes a member of a transcription/chromatin remodelling complex required for the incorporation of H3.3 at pericentric heterochromatin and at telomeres, as well as at several transcription factor binding sites7, 14, 15, 16, 17. We extended our WES analysis to 42 additional tumour samples and focused on ATRX and H3F3A, as well as DAXX (because the gene product heterodimerizes with ATRX and participates in H3.3 recruitment to DNA6, 7). A total of 15 samples had heterozygous H3.3 mutations (9 K27M, 5 G34R, 1 G34V) and 14 samples had a mutation in ATRX, including frameshift insertions/deletions (6 samples), gains of a stop codon (4 samples), and missense SNVs (4 samples). Nearly all of the ATRX mutations occurred either within the carboxy-terminal helicase domain or led to truncation of the protein upstream of this domain (Fig. 1c). Mutations were accompanied by an absence of detectable ATRX protein by immunohistochemistry in samples for which paraffin material was available (Supplementary Fig. 1). Two samples had heterozygous DAXX mutations, simultaneously with an ATRX mutation in one sample (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 3). Overall, 21 of 48 samples (44%) had a mutation in at least one of these three genes. Notably, we also identified TP53 mutations in 26 samples (25 somatic, 1 germline in PGBM26), which overlapped significantly with samples that had ATRX, DAXX and/or H3F3A mutations (18/21 cases, 86%, Fig. 1d; P = 1.1 × 10−4, permutation test). A list of all mutations discovered by WES in selected genes associated with GBM is given in Supplementary Table 5.  Figure 1: Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. Most frequent mutations in paediatric GBM. a, Most frequent somatic mutations in 48 paediatric glioblastoma tumours. Mutations identified in genes listed in this table were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and were not present in dbSNP nor in the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), except for the TP53 SNP at R273, which is associated with cancer. Detailed description of the mutations in affected samples is provided in Supplementary Table 5. b, Three recurrent non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were observed in H3F3A. The K27M, G34R and G34V mutations are shown in the context of the common post-translational modifications of the H3.3 N-terminal tail, which regulates the histone code. H3.3 has 136 amino acids, and is highly conserved across species from mammals to plants, including the residues subject to mutation in paediatric GBM (see multiple alignment of amino acids 11 to 60). c, Schematic of the mutations observed in ATRX in the 48 WES samples. d, Schematic of the overlap between mutations affecting ATRX-DAXX, H3F3A and TP53.

To investigate whether H3F3A mutations are specific to GBM and/or paediatric disease, we sequenced this gene in 784 glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range (Fig. 2a). H3.3 mutations were highly specific to GBM and were much more prevalent in the paediatric setting (32/90, 36%), although they also occurred rarely in young adults with GBM (11/318, 3%) (Fig. 2b). K27M-H3.3 mutations occurred mainly in younger patients (median age 11 years, range 5–29) and thalamic GBM (Supplementary Table 1), whereas G34R- or G34V-H3.3 mutations occurred in older patients (median age 20 years, range 9–42) and in tumours of the cerebral hemispheres (Fig. 2b). Further comparison of our data set with adult GBM databases8, 10, 11, 18, 19 indicated limited overlap in frequently mutated genes between paediatric GBM and any of the four previously described adult GBM subtypes18 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 6).

No H3.3 mutations were identified in older patients with GBM. c, Comparison of the most frequently mutated genes in paediatric and adult GBM shows that H3F3A, ATRX and DAXX mutations are largely specific to paediatric disease. Except for similarities in the mutation rate for TP53 and PDGFRA with the previously identified proneural adult GBM subgroup, the rate and type of genes mutated were distinct between paediatric and adult GBM whatever the molecular subgroup27 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Data for adult GBM regarding other genes included in the table was compiled from refs 11 and 18. d, ATRX and DAXX immunohistochemical staining of a paediatric GBM tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 samples.

A follow-up study found ATRX mutations in a series of cancers, including GBM, where ATRX (but not DAXX) mutations were identified in 3/21 paediatric GBMs (14%) and 8/122 adult GBMs (7%)20. To evaluate further the prevalence of ATRX and DAXX mutations in paediatric GBM, we performed immunostaining for these proteins on a well-characterized tissue microarray (TMA) with samples from 124 paediatric GBM patients. Lack of immunopositivity for ATRX was seen in 35% of cases (40/113 scored, 22 females and 18 males) and for DAXX in 6% (7/124 scored) (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, 37% of samples had lost nuclear expression of either factor, corroborating our WES findings. Strikingly, ATRX-DAXX mutations (as assessed by direct sequencing or loss of protein expression) were found in 100% of G34-H3.3 mutant cases in the larger cohort of GBMs (13/13) where sufficient material was available (P = 1.4 × 10−8, permutation test). The overlap of ATRX mutations with K27M-H3.3-mutated samples was not significant in either the exome data set (3/9 samples, P = 0.58) or the full set of GBM screened (5/13, P = 0.40) (Fig. 2e).  The histone code—post-translational modifications of specific histone residues—regulates virtually all processes that act on or depend on DNA, including replication and repair, regulation of gene expression, and maintenance of centromeres and telomeres21. Accordingly, although recurrent histone mutations have not previously been reported in cancer, mutations in genes affecting histone post-translational modifications are increasingly described22. H3.3 is a universal, replication-independent histone predominantly incorporated into transcription sites and telomeric regions, and associated with active and open chromatin (reviewed in ref. 23). This role is conserved in the single histone H3 present in yeast, indicating its importance throughout evolution. It functions as a neutral replacement histone, but also participates in the epigenetic transmission of active chromatin states and is associated with chromatin assembly factors in large-scale replication-independent chromatin remodelling events23.  The non-random recurrence of the exact same mutation in different tumours, and the absence of truncating mutations, indicate that H3F3A mutations are most probably gain-of-function events. Lysine 27 is a critical residue of histone 3 and its variants, and methylation at this position (H3K27me), which may be mimicked by the terminal CH3 of methionine substituted at this residue, is commonly associated with transcriptional repression24. In contrast, H3K36 methylation or acetylation typically promotes gene transcription25, 26. Thus, although their morphological phenotype is very similar (K27M and G34R/V mutant tumours are histologically indistinguishable), the two H3.3 variants are expected to act through a different set of genes. This indeed seems to be the case when looking at expression profiles of GBMs harbouring these two mutations. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression from 27 of the WES cohort samples for which sufficient RNA was available revealed a clear separation in the expression of K27M versus G34R/V mutant samples (Supplementary Fig. 3). Further analysis of just those samples harbouring an H3F3A mutation additionally showed a clear distinction in the expression pattern of these two variants (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). Among these differentially expressed genes were several linked to brain development that showed a clear mutation-specific expression pattern when comparing both between K27 and G34 mutants and with H3.3 wild-type GBMs, including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 (Fig. 3b). We also identified increased levels of H3K36 trimethylation in cells carrying the G34V-H3.3 mutation in one sample for which we had available material (PGBM14) compared to other cells, potentially supporting this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig. 5).  Figure 3: H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. H3F3A mutation variants show distinct expression profiles and are associated with alternative lengthening of telomeres. a, Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes in 27 of the 48 GBM samples analysed by whole-exome sequencing shows that samples with K27M and G34R/V H3.3 have specific gene expression profiles. Clustering was based on the top 100 genes by standard deviation from autosomal genes detected as present in >10% of samples (see also Supplementary Fig. 3). b, Genes involved in development and differentiation show H3.3 mutation-specific expression patterns. Expression levels of developmental-related genes including DLX2, SFRP2, FZD7 and MYT1 are distinct among H3.3-K27 mutant and H3.3-G34 mutants following gene expression profiling (see also Supplementary Table 7). c, Alternate lengthening of telomere (ALT) is associated with the presence of mutant H3F3A/ATRX in a tissue microarray (TMA) comprising 124 paediatric GBM samples. We assessed ALT using telomere-specific FISH (shown here and in Supplementary Fig. 4) on the paediatric TMA we investigated for ATRX expression (Fig. 2d) and using telomere-specific Southern blotting of high molecular weight genomic DNA (data not shown). Fisher’s exact test was used to identify any association relationship.

We performed telomere-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on the samples with K27M or G34R/V mutations identified by WES for which we had slides available (Supplementary Fig. 4) and on the paediatric GBM TMA (Fig. 3c). These experiments showed that ALT is strongly correlated with ATRX loss (37/47 samples with ALT showed ATRX loss, P < 0.001). However, some samples with nuclear ATRX staining still showed ALT, indicating that additional defects may also account for elongated telomeres in GBM. The presence of ALT was best explained by the simultaneous presence of ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations (P = 0.0002, Fisher’s exact test). Tumours without ATRX/H3F3A/TP53 mutations almost invariably showed shorter telomeres than are observed with ALT, as seen in telomerase-positive gliomas27.  Genetic stability was also assessed through evaluating DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) in 31 of the 48 tumours using Illumina SNP arrays containing ~2.5 million oligonucleotides (Supplementary Tables 1, 8, 9). Loss of heterozygosity (whole chromosome changes, broad and focal heterozygous deletions, Supplementary Table 9) was common in paediatric GBM samples, as we have previously reported4, and the focal gains and losses we identified in our study showed a high degree of overlap with other published paediatric data sets3, 21. The number of CNAs per tumour was higher in samples with H3F3A/ATRX-DAXX/TP53 mutations (Supplementary Fig. 6).  Recurrent point mutations in IDH1 (mainly R132H) are gain of function mutations commonly identified in secondary GBM and the lower-grade tumours from which they develop (86–98% of these astrocytomas), and typically occur in younger adults11, 28. Strikingly, IDH1 and H3F3A mutations were mutually exclusive in our sequencing cohort (P = 1.6 × 10−4). Neomorphic enzyme activity resulting from IDH1 mutation leads to the production of high quantities of the onco-metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)29. Increased 2-HG inhibits histone demethylases, specifically inducing increased methylation of both H3K27 and H3K3629, 30, the two residues affected directly (K27) or indirectly (K36) by the mutations in H3F3A uncovered in this study. Furthermore, overlap of H3F3A and TP53 mutations in children with GBM (all of the G34R/V and 82% of K27M mutants also harbour TP53 mutations) mirrors the large overlap of IDH1 mutations with TP53 mutations in the proneural adult GBM sub-group18. Thus, mutations which directly (H3F3A), or indirectly (IDH1) affect the methylation of H3.3 K27 or H3.3 K36, in combination with TP53 mutations, characterize the pathogenesis of paediatric and young adult GBM.  Our data indicate a central role of H3.3/ATRX-DAXX perturbation in paediatric GBM. Mutant H3.3 recruitment would occur across the genome and induce abnormal patterns of chromatin remodelling to yield distinct gene expression profiles for the K27 and G34 mutations. Additional loss of ATRX may act to reduce H3.3 incorporation at a subset of genes important in oncogenesis, preventing mutant H3.3 from altering their transcription. ATRX loss will also impair H3.3 loading at telomeres and disrupt their heterochromatic state, facilitating alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Our findings provide an intriguing example of the interplay of genetic and epigenetic events in driving cancer, indicate a new mechanism through which these epigenetic alterations are brought about (mutation of key residues in a regulatory histone), and provide a rationale for targeting the chromatin remodelling machinery in this deadly paediatric cancer.  Methods Main• Methods• References• Acknowledgements• Author information• Supplementary information Sample characteristics and pathological review All samples were obtained with informed consent after approval of the Institutional Review Board of the respective hospitals they were treated in and were independently reviewed by senior paediatric neuropathologists (S.A., A.K.) according to the WHO guidelines. Forty-eight paediatric grade IV astrocytomas (glioblastoma GBM) patients between the age of 3 and 20 years were included in the study. Clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Samples were taken at the time of the first surgery, before further treatment as needed. Tissues were obtained from the London/Ontario Tumour Bank of the Pediatric Cooperative Health Tissue Network, the Montreal Children’s Hospital and from collaborators in Hungary and Germany. Seven hundred and eighty-four glioma samples from all grades and histological diagnoses across the entire age range in this study were obtained from collaborators across Europe and North America.  Alignment and variant calling for whole-exome sequencing We followed standard manufacturer protocols to perform target capture with the Illumina TruSeq exome enrichment kit and sequencing of 100 bp paired end reads on Illumina HiSeq. We generated approximately 10 Gb of sequence for each subject such that >90% of the coding bases of the exome defined by the consensus coding sequence (CCDS) project were covered by at least 10 reads. We removed adaptor sequences and quality trimmed reads using the Fastx toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and then used a custom script to ensure that only read pairs with both mates present were subsequently used. Reads were aligned to hg19 with BWA31, and duplicate reads were marked using Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/) and excluded from downstream analyses. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) were called using samtools (http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) pileup and varFilter32 with the base alignment quality (BAQ) adjustment disabled, and were then quality filtered to require at least 20% of reads supporting the variant call. Variants were annotated using both ANNOVAR33 and custom scripts to identify whether they affected protein coding sequence, and whether they had previously been seen in dbSNP131, the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011), or in approximately 160 exomes previously sequenced at our centre.  Somatic mutation identification for whole-exome sequencing A variant called in a tumour was considered to be a candidate somatic mutation if the matched normal sample had at least 10 reads covering this position and had zero variant reads, and the variant was not reported in dbSNP131 or the 1000 Genomes data set (October 2011). For the resulting 117 candidate somatic mutations, we manually examined the alignment of each to check for sequencing artefacts and alignment errors. Fifteen variants were easily identified as sequence-specific error artefacts commonly seen shortly downstream of GGC sequences on Illumina sequencers34. Once genes of interest were identified (H3F3A, ATRX, DAXX, TP53, NF1), we examined positions in these genes in the 34 tumour samples where less than 20% of the reads supported the variant. This identified only two additional variants, both in sample PGBM19 where there were low read counts for frameshift insertions in both ATRX (6/32 reads) and DAXX (8/47 reads).  Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of paediatric GBM and TMA (4 µm) were immunohistochemically stained for ATRX and DAXX proteins. Unstained sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 min at sub-boiling temperatures. Individual slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-ATRX (1:750 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA001906) or rabbit anti-DAXX (1:100 dilution, Sigma, catalogue no. HPA008736) antibodies. After incubation with the primary antibody, secondary biotin-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson) were applied for 30 min. After washing with PBS, slides were developed with diaminobenzidine (Dako) as the chromogen. All slides were counterstained using Harris haematoxylin. The criterion for positive staining was described previously20. Immunohistochemistry staining on TMA was scored by three individuals independently, including a pathologist. To test the level of mono-, di- and trimethylated H3 at position K36, cell lysates from tumour cells were analysed by western blot. Antibodies against H3K36me3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9050), H3K36me2 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9049), H3K36me1 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab9048) and H3.3 (Abcam, catalogue no. ab97968) were used, with conditions suggested by the manufacturer.  Gene expression profiling Total RNA from frozen samples was hybridized to Affymetrix-HG-U133 plus 2.0 gene chips (Affymetrix). Array quality assurance was determined using β-actin and GAPDH 3′/5′ ratio, as recommended by the manufacturer.  Genome-wide SNP array DNA from 31 of the 48 paediatric GBM tumours analysed by whole-exome sequencing was hybridized to Illumina Human Omni 2.5M Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) arrays, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Copy number alterations were analysed using Illumina GenomeStudio Data Analysis Software (Illumina) as previously described35. Statistical analysis of Fisher’s exact test was performed using GraphPad Prism software.  Telomere specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Telomere-specific FISH was done using a standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded FISH protocol (as described in ref. 20), using a FITC peptide nucleic acid telomere probe from Dako.

       "Genes encoding components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer, but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR, the gene for the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor Deptor. mTORC1 signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation. Lastly, cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations display heightened sensitivity to rapamycin both in culture and as in vivo xenografts, suggesting that such mutations confer mTOR pathway dependency.  Keywords: personalized, mTOR, mutations, biomarker, deptor Go to: Introduction In mammals, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway regulates cell size, mRNA translation, autophagy and many metabolic processes, including lipid synthesis (1). A variety of upstream regulators control the activity of the serine/threonine protein kinase mTOR and many of these are deregulated in cancer, resulting in pathway hyperactivation. Such activation occurs most commonly through loss-of-function mutations in tumor suppressors, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), tuberous sclerosis 1/2 (TSC1/2), neurofibromin 1/2 (NF1/2), or oncogenic mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, or AKT (2). However, few cancer-associated mutations have been functionally characterized in MTOR itself, with only two reports thus far describing such mutations. In the first report, the authors tested six cancer-associated MTOR mutations and observed that two (S2215Y from a colorectal sample and R2505P from a kidney sample) conferred mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation (3). In the second report, the authors identified an mTORC1 activating MTOR mutation (L2431P) that was present in a portion but not the entirety of a primary kidney tumor (4). Although these initial reports establish that activating MTOR mutations do arise in cancer, they were based upon limited sample sets that do not reflect the diverse subtypes of cancer. More recently, cancer genome sequencing projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), have identified a vast number of somatic mutations in thousands of tumors from more than 40 cancer subtypes (5-7).  Using publicly available databases of cancer genome sequence data, we cataloged all mutations in mTOR pathway components. We annotated over 400 samples with missense mutations in the MTOR gene from dozens of cancer subtypes, most of which lie within six clusters in the part of the gene that encodes the C-terminal portion of mTOR. Furthermore, through functional analyses, we identify 33 novel mTOR pathway-activating mutations, some of which affect the capacity of mTOR to interact with its partner proteins. None of the activating mutations impact the sensitivity of mTORC1 activity in cells to mTOR inhibitors but a subset confer mTORC1 signaling resistance to nutrient deprivation. Importantly, cancer cells that naturally express a subset of the mutations are hypersensitive to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. These findings may have translational relevance as rapamycin analogs (rapalogs) are clinically approved for the treatment of cancer, and several ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors are in development (8). As tumor biopsies are increasingly subjected to whole exome sequencing, the hyperactivating MTOR mutations we characterize may serve as biomarkers in predicting cancer response to mTOR-targeting drugs.  Go to: Results Catalog of recurring mutations in genes encoding mTOR pathway components  To generate a comprehensive catalog of all cancer-associated missense mutations in canonical genes of the mTOR pathway, we analyzed partial genome sequencing data from the TCGA, CCLE, International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) databases (5-7, 9, 10). This analysis revealed that almost every gene in the mTOR pathway harbored somatic point mutations (Supplementary Table 1). To enrich for mutations that are more likely to affect pathway function, only mutations that alter the same codon more than once were counted. When normalized for gene length, this analysis revealed that MTOR contained the highest percentage of recurring mutations, and thus we focused most of our attention on these mutations (Supplementary Figure 1). Collectively, through data mining and a literature search, we curated over 400 samples with non-synonymous MTOR point mutations (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table 2) (11-17). While the majority of these mutations are represented by only one sample in our database, approximately 40% are recurrent, most of which have not been previously described. Additionally, the mutations cluster in six distinct regions of mTOR centered on highly recurrent mutations that alter amino acids C1483, E1799, T1977, S2215, L2427 and R2505 (Figure 1C). The presence of these clusters suggests that there is a selective advantage to acquiring mutations in certain regions of the mTOR protein. Furthermore, these mutations are present in multiple cancer subtypes, with the highest number in colorectal, endometrial, and lung cancers, although these cancer subtypes are also considered to have the highest mutation rates (Figures 1D and 1E) (18). Interestingly, a random mutagenesis screen in the S. pombe mTOR homolog (tor2) identified activating mutations in homologous amino acid positions to many of those we find in MTOR to be recurrently mutated in cancer (19) (Supplementary Table 3).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Cancer-associated MTOR mutations mTORC1/2 activating mutations in MTOR  The prevalence of the recurrent mutations, their clustering, and correlation with activating tor2 mutations strongly suggested that the MTOR mutations impact mTOR pathway activity. To test this possibility, wild-type (WT) or ten different mutants of mTOR (L1460P, C1483F, E1799K, F1888L, T1977R, V2006I, S2215Y, I2500F, R2505P, and D2512H) were expressed in cells and phosphorylation of the mTORC1/2 substrates S6K1, 4EBP1, or Akt1 examined (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C). All the mTOR mutants conferred varying degrees of pathway activation, and, interestingly, a few displayed some substrate preference (L1460P, C1483F, S2215Y, and R2505P towards S6K1/4EBP1 or V2006I towards Akt1), implying that these mutations have greater effects on mTORC1 or mTORC2. Thus, while three pathway activating MTOR mutations have previously been identified (3, 4), our initial analyses uncovered an additional eight recurrent MTOR mutations which activate mTORC1 and/or mTORC2.  Figure 2 Figure 2 mTORC1 and mTORC2 activating mutations in MTOR and RHEB It is well established that two activating mutations (E545K and H1047R) within the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PI3K-p110α), encoded by the PIK3CA gene, can lead to mTOR pathway activation (20). To determine the degree of mTOR pathway activation conferred by mTOR mutation, S6K1 phosphorylation from cells expressing WT or S2215Y mTOR was compared to cells expressing WT or mutant PI3K-p110α (Supplementary Figures 2A and 2B). This revealed that while expression of only mutant mTOR conferred mTORC1 activation, expression of either WT or mutant PI3K-p110α induced mTORC1 activity.  Non-recurrent MTOR mutations that activate mTORC1 signaling  We next examined in more detail the nature of the activating MTOR mutations, and observed that while some codons are mutated to only one other residue (e.g. E1799K), others are mutated to several different amino acids (e.g. S2215F/P/T/Y). This is reminiscent of the diverse amino acids to which the G12 residue of KRAS is mutated in cancers (21). We expressed 20 such MTOR mutations and found that many (C1483R/W/Y, F1888I, T1977K, S2215F/P, I2500M), but not all (A41P/S/T, F1888V, T1977S, V2006L, S2215T, R2505Q/*, D2512G/Y), led to increased S6K1 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figures 3 and 5, and data not shown). Given that most of these activating mutations are found only once in our dataset implies that other non-recurrent mutations may also activate mTORC1 signaling. To identify other such mutations, we turned our attention to the mutational clusters identified in Figure 1, and observed that while most are represented by several tissue types, those in the C1483 cluster are particularly prevalent in kidney cancer (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 3D). Interestingly, two recent cancer genome sequencing efforts reported that kidney cancers have an increased percentage of mutations in mTOR pathway genes, but the functional consequences of these mutations were not evaluated (13, 22). Expression of the ten kidney cancer-associated MTOR mutations from the C1483 cluster revealed that in addition to the previously evaluated L1460P and C1483F/Y mutants (Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure 2), three non-recurrent mutants (L1433S, A1459P, and E1519T) also induced mTORC1 pathway activity (Figure 2D). Similarly, expression of eight non-recurrent mutations from the S2215 cluster (N2206S, L2209V, A2210P, L2216P, R2217W, L2220F, Q2223K, and A2226S) activated mTORC1 signaling as measured by S6K1 phosphorylation, with the L2209V mutant conferring higher activation than even S2215Y (Supplementary Figure 3E). Lastly, other than the S2215Y and R2505P mutations, the only other cancer-associated MTOR mutation previously characterized is L2431P from a kidney cancer patient (4). Expression of mTOR containing this non-recurrent mutation caused mTORC1 activation that was much weaker than that caused by expression of the S2215Y mutant (Supplementary Figure 3F). Collectively, these results suggest that while most non-recurrent MTOR mutations found in cancer are part of the mutational “noise”, there exists a diverse set of MTOR mutations that can drive mTORC1 pathway activity. Likely, as more cancer genomes are sequenced, the activating non-recurrent mutations we identified will prove to be recurrent.  Recurrent mutations in RHEB activate mTORC1  We also observed that other mTOR pathway genes such as Raptor, Rictor, and Rheb1 harbored recurrent mutations (Supplemental Table 1). Expression of Rheb1 Y35N/C/H and to a lesser degree E139K increased phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 more than that of WT Rheb1 (Figure 2E), while recurrent mutations in Raptor (R788C) or Rictor (S1101L) failed to induce any mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity (data not shown). In support of the relevance of these mutations to cancer, RHEB was recently highlighted as a novel cancer gene due to the presence of the Y35N mutation (23). Thus, cancer associated mutations in either MTOR or RHEB can induce mTORC1 activity; whether this is true of other mTOR pathway genes remains to be determined.  mTORC1/2 hyperactivating mutants bind less Deptor  One potential mechanism through which the mutations in mTOR (Figure 2) might increase S6K1/Akt1 phosphorylation is by altering mTORC1 or mTORC2 assembly. Alternatively or in addition, the mTOR mutations may diminish the binding of mTOR to its endogenous inhibitor Deptor, which binds to the FAT domain of mTOR (24). To test these possibilities, the interactions of exogenously expressed WT or mutant mTORs with endogenous Raptor, Rictor, and Deptor were measured. All mutant mTOR proteins bound equally well to Raptor and Rictor, suggesting that the mutations do not affect formation of either mTOR complex (Figure 3A). In contrast, Deptor binding to the immunoprecipitated mTOR proteins was reduced in cells expressing the mTOR mutants as compared to WT mTOR (Figure 3A). Given that increased mTOR pathway activity correlates with a reduction in the mTOR-Deptor interaction (24), it is likely that the observed decrease in Deptor binding reflects the increased mTOR pathway activity caused by the MTOR mutations. However, two mTORC1 activating mutations that are in the FAT domain of mTOR, L1460P and C1483Y, bound much less Deptor than the other mutants tested (Figure 3A), suggesting that these mutations directly perturb the Deptor binding site on mTOR. Consistent with this, examination of the mutations from the C1483 cluster described in figure 2D revealed that two other highly activating mutations in the FAT domain (A1459P and C1483Y) also strongly reduced the mTOR-Deptor interaction (Supplementary Figure 4A). While these results suggest a possible mechanism of action for a subset of activating mTOR mutations, they do not preclude other mechanism by which MTOR mutations may impact mTORC1 signaling, such as by increasing the activity of the mTOR kinase domain.  Figure 3 Figure 3 mTOR mutants bind less Deptor and cells expressing the mTOR S2215Y mutation are resistant to nutrient deprivation MTOR mutations do not affect mTORC1 sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors but can affect the pathway response to nutrient deprivation  We next considered the possibility that the mTORC1-activating MTOR mutants have altered sensitivity to established mTOR inhibitors. Engineered mutations in the FRB domain of mTOR, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex, confer marked rapamycin resistance to mTOR (25). To test whether mTOR mutation alters pathway inhibition by rapamycin or Torin1 (an investigational ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor), we used HEK-293 cells with an integrated FLP recombination site (TREX cells) to stably express WT or several different mutants of mTOR (A1459P, C1483Y, E1799K, F1888I, L2209V, S2215Y, L2431P, I2500F, and R2505P), as the mTOR cDNA is too large to be packaged and expressed via a lentiviral delivery system (Supplementary Figure 4B). Baseline phosphorylation of endogenous S6K1 was higher in TREX cells expressing the A1459P, L2209V, S2215Y, I2500F and R2505P mTOR mutants than in parental or WT-expressing cells (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D), consistent with the results obtained upon transient expression of these mutants (Figures 2A and 2D, and Supplementary Figure 3D). Importantly, mTORC1 activity in none of the TREX cells was resistant to rapamycin, Torin1, MLN0128 (an mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor), GDC0980 (a dual PI3K/mTOR ATP-competitive inhibitor), (Figure 3B and Supplementary Figures 4C and 4D). Thus, on a molecular level, while cells with mTOR mutations may display high levels of mTORC1/2 activity, this activity is still sensitive to pharmacological mTOR inhibition.  The kinase activity of mTOR is tightly regulated by nutrient availability; when cells are starved of nutrients (specifically glucose and amino acids), they downregulate mTORC1 signaling, while retreatment of cells with these nutrients restores mTORC1-mediated signaling (26). Given this, we sought to determine whether any of the activating mTOR mutants affect the sensitivity of mTORC1 signaling to amino acid or glucose withdrawal. Indeed, S6K1 phosphorylation was highly resistant to deprivation of either nutrient in cells expressing several mutants (A1459P, S2215Y, I2500F and R2505P) (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figures 4E and 4F). This observation may be relevant in the context of developing tumors, which are often glucose starved (27, 28), where inappropriate mTORC1 activity may provide a growth advantage.  Cancer cells with hyperactivating MTOR mutations are hypersensitive to rapamycin in vitro and in vivo  To determine if cancer cells with MTOR mutations are dependent on mTORC1 activity, we evaluated the impact of rapamycin on the proliferation of set of cancer cell lines harboring WT or mutant mTOR (Figure 4A). We identified four cell lines with mTORC1-activating MTOR mutations (C1483Y in MOLT16; E1799K in HEC59 and SNU349; and S2215Y in JHUEM7) and two with MTOR mutations that have no apparent impact on mTORC1 signaling (V2006L in TUHR10TKB; and R2152C in A375) (Supplementary Figures 5A and 5B). HeLa cells were used as a negative control cell line, as they are mildly rapamycin sensitive and are wild-type for mTOR (7, 29). MCF7 and SW780 cells, which are also wild-type for mTOR, served as positive controls for rapamycin sensitivity because the MCF7 cells harbor an activating PI3K-p110α mutation (E545K) while the SW780 cells lack NPRL2, which encodes a component of the GATOR1 negative regulator of the amino acid-sensing pathway (30, 31). Importantly, only the cell lines with activating MTOR mutations, the PI3K-p110α mutant, or the NPRL2-null SW780 cells were hypersensitive to rapamycin treatment (Figure 4B). Consistent with these and published results, the growth of HeLa xenografts was partially rapamycin sensitive, while rapamycin completely halted the growth of HEC59 xenografts, which carry the hyperactivating mTOR E1799K mutation (Figure 4C) (32, 33). These results suggest that the presence of hyperactivating MTOR mutations in cancer cells may serve as biomarkers to identify tumors that are likely to respond to mTOR inhibitors.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Rapamycin inhibits the proliferation of cancer cell lines with hyperactivating MTOR mutations Go to: Discussion Early cancer genome sequencing projects led to the identification of three mutations in MTOR that were shown to activate mTORC1 signaling (3, 4). Here, we have identified an additional 33 previously unknown activating MTOR mutations (some are recurrent, others are not) (Supplementary Table 4). Mechanistically, we find that the activating mutations diminish the mTOR-Deptor interaction and interestingly, when mapped onto the recently solved crystal structure of mTOR, the mutations cluster in several distinct locations within the protein itself, suggesting that other activating mechanisms may exist (Supplementary Figure 6) (34). While the mutations do not prevent pharmacological mTOR inhibition, a subset protect against the effects of nutrient deprivation on mTORC1 signaling. Lastly, we demonstrate that cell lines with activating MTOR mutations are particularly sensitive to rapamycin in cell culture and in xenografts, likely due to mTOR pathway dependency.  The diversity of activating MTOR mutations we characterized is reminiscent of the various activating mutations in the prototypical lipid kinase PIK3CA, which encodes for the PI3K catalytic subunit p110α (35). However, unlike the activating PIK3CA mutations, which confer equal activation of PI3K-mediated signaling pathways, the diverse MTOR mutations can differentially activate mTORC1 or mTORC2, leading to either S6K1/4EBP1 or Akt1 phosphorylation, respectively. This finding is particularly relevant in a clinical setting, as patients with mTORC1 activating mutations may respond well to FDA-approved rapalogs, while patients with mTORC2 activating mutations might best be treated with ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, although such inhibitors are still in clinical trials. This distinction is especially relevant for patients with mTORC2 activating mutations, because rapalogs can in some cases upregulate mTORC2 signaling through modulation of an mTORC1-dependent feedback loop (36).  Rapalog-based therapies are currently approved or in clinical trials for several cancer subtypes, and some patients have had dramatic and durable responses to these therapies (37). Given that some cells with activating MTOR mutations are particularly rapamycin sensitive (Figure 4), it is possible that some of the rapalog-responsive patients had tumors with similar mutations. Indeed, it was recently found that the tumor of a bladder cancer patient with two activating MTOR mutations displayed exquisite sensitivity to rapalog-based therapy (38). Many more cancer-associated MTOR mutations will likely be identified in future studies, but functional evaluation of these mutations will be required to determine their impact on the mTOR pathway. As tumor sequencing becomes more commonplace, functional studies such as ours may aid in arriving at a more personalized treatment regimen that eventually promotes patient survival.  Go to: Methods Data acquisition and cluster analysis  All mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway were acquired from the cBIO, COSMIC, and ICGC databases or through a literature search with a data-freeze date of September 1, 2013. To identify regions of mTOR significantly enriched for somatic point mutations, we determined the probability of seeing at least the observed number of mutations in a 50 amino acid sliding window with the null hypothesis being all 463 MTOR mutations randomly occurring across the 2549 amino acid protein. Specifically, we calculated a threshold for significance of at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids by the formula:  p=∑n=k463(463k)∗(1−502549)463−k∗(502549)k which equals 0.043 for k = at least 15 mutations per 50 amino acids.  Materials  Reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies to HA (clone C29F4), S6K1 (clone 49D7), phospho-T389-S6K1 (clone 108D2), and phospho-S473-Akt1 (clone D9E) from Cell Signaling Technology; antibody to GAPDH (clone GT239) from Genetex; antibodies to Deptor and Raptor, X-ray film, and PVDF membrane were from Millipore; antibody to Rictor from Bethyl; antibody to the Flag epitope (clone M2), Flag M2-coupled agarose beads, glucose and amino acid mixtures from Sigma; horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; FuGENE HD and Cell Titer Glo from Promega; X-tremeGENE 9 and Complete Protease Mixture from Roche Applied Science; QuikChange II XL from Stratagene; enhanced chemiluminescence reagent and glutathione-coupled agarose beads from Thermo; 8-week-old nude mice from Taconic; rapamycin from LC Labs; MLN0128 and GDC0980 from Selleckchem; and Torin1 was synthesized in the Gray laboratory (39). cDNAs for mTOR and PI3K-p110α were from Addgene; expression vectors for HAGST-S6K1, HA-GST-Akt1, and HA-GST-Rheb1 were described previously (24, 40, 41) and Flag-14-3-3α was a generous gift from the Yaffe lab. The primers used to generate the mTOR and Rheb1 mutations were from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in supplemental table 5. HEK-293T-TREX cell system, 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels, and 20x MOPS buffers were from Invitrogen.  Tissue culture and cell lines  MCF7, HELA, HEK-293T, HCT116, A375 and SW780 cells were from ATCC; JHUEM7, MOLT16, NCIH446, SNU349, and TUHR10TKB cells were from the Broad Institute Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia; HEK-293E cells were a generous gift of the Blenis lab; and the HEC59 cells were a generous gift of the Lippard lab. The cell lines have not been re-authenticated, although those from ATCC and the Broad were used within 6 months of resuscitation. The HEK-293T, HEK-293E, HCT116, A375, HEC59, and TUHR10TKB cells were cultured in DMEM; JHUEM7 and MOLT16 cells were cultured in RPMI; and the SW780 cells were cultured in IMDM. All media was prepared with 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO2.  Site-directed mutagenesis, cloning, and TREX cell line generation  All MTOR and RHEB point mutations were generated in the parental vectors using site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange II XL kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 5. Point mutations were verified using Sanger sequencing as conducted by Eton Biosciences. The HA-GST-4EBP1 reporter vector was generated by synthesizing a gBlock from IDT encoding for 4EBP1 and cloning it into the pRK5-HA-GST vector using SalI and NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. WT and mutant mTOR cDNAs were subcloned directly from the pcDNA3 vector into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector using single site NotI restriction digestion followed by ligation. Flag-mTOR-expressing TREX cells were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Cell treatments, lysis, and immunoprecipitations  For S6K1 and Akt1 co-transfection assays, 3×105 HEK-293T or HEK-293E cells per well were seeded into 6-well tissue culture plates, transfected 24 hours later with 2 μg of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 1 ng of S6K1- or Akt1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9 or FuGENE HD, followed by whole cell lysis 48 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM EDTA at pH8.0, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 15 mM Na3VO4, 100 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer). 200-400 μg of whole cell lysates were mixed with 5x SDS-sample buffer to a final concentration of 1-2 μg/μL, boiled for 5 minutes, and then used directly for immunoblotting or frozen at −20°C. For glutathione pull down assays, 2×106 HEK-293T cells were seeded onto 10 cm tissue culture plates, transfected 24 hours later with 10 μg of mTOR-encoding plasmid and 2 ng of S6K1-encoding plasmid using X-tremeGENE 9, and lysed 48-72 hours after transfection in NP-40 lysis buffer. 2-3 mg of the resultant whole-cell lysates were incubated with 30 μL of pre-washed glutathione-coupled agarose beads in a 1 mL volume, which were rotated at 4°C for two hours, spun at 2,500 RCF for one minute, washed in 500 μL lysis buffer three times, and the beads directly boiled in 50 μL of 2x SDS-sample buffer. For mTOR immunoprecipitations, the cells were treated as with the glutathione pulldown, except they were lysed/washed in CHAPS buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.4% CHAPS, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na-pyrophosphate, 100 mM β-glycerophosphate, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor per 50 mL of buffer) and incubated with Flag-M2-coupled agarose beads.  Immunoblotting  10-50 μg of whole cell lysates, 10-30 μL of glutathione pulldown samples, or 10-30 μL of Flag-M2 immunoprecipitates were loaded into lanes of 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gels, run at 120 volts for 2 hours in 1x MOPS buffer, and then transferred to 0.45 μm PVDF membrane at 60 volts for 2 hours in 1x transfer buffer (100 mM CAPS, 123 mM NaOH, 10% Ethanol). The membranes were then immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. All primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA W/V TBST, with the exception of GAPDH and Flag antibodies which were diluted 1:2000. All secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% milk W/V TBST. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ and a student's T test was used to determine statistical significance.  Rapamycin, Torin1, MLN0128, GDC0980, and nutrient starvation/re-stimulation treatments  For the mTOR inhibitor experiments, 3×105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates, grown for one day, treated with 100 nM rapamycin, 250 nM Torin1, 250 nM MLN0128, 250 nM GDC0980, or DMSO for 60 minutes. The cells were then lysed as above. For the nutrient deprivation experiments, 3×105 TREX cells per well were seeded into 6-well plates, grown for one day, rinsed briefly in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI, incubated in 1x amino acid- or glucose-free RPMI for 60 minutes, and then stimulated with free amino acids or glucose to the levels in complete RPMI for 15 minutes.  In vitro proliferation assays  Six replicates each of 800-1200 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, treated with 8 doses of rapamycin 24 hours later, and assayed for ATP content using Cell Titer Glo 96 hours following rapamycin treatment according to the manufacturer's protocol.  In vivo xenograft assays  3×106 cells per injection site were implanted subcutaneously into the right and left flanks of nude mice. Once tumors were palpable in all animals (>50 mm3 volume by caliper measurements), mice were assigned randomly into rapamycin treated or untreated groups and caliper measurements were taken every 3-4 days until tumor burden approached the limits set by institutional guidelines. Tumor volume was assessed according to the formula (0.5)(W)(W)(L), and a student's T test was used to determine the p-values. Rapamycin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle was delivered by daily IP injection, 100 mL per injection. All experiments involving mice were carried out with approval from the Committee for Animal Care at MIT and under supervision of the Department of Comparative Medicine at MIT.   Significance  We report that a diverse set of cancer-associated MTOR mutations confer increased mTORC1/2 pathway activity and that cells harboring these mutations are highly sensitive to rapamycin in culture and in vivo. These findings are clinically relevant as the MTOR mutations characterized herein may serve as biomarkers for predicting tumor responses to mTOR inhibitors.

       "Genetic screening of the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 has uncovered a large number of variants of uncertain clinical significance. Here, we use biochemical and cellbased transcriptional assays to assess the structural and functional defects associated with a large set of 117 distinct BRCA1 missense variants within the essential BRCT domain of the BRCA1 protein that have been documented in individuals with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. In the first method, we used limited proteolysis to assess the protein folding stability of each of the mutants compared with the wild-type. In the second method, we used a phosphopeptide pull-down assay to assess the ability of each of the variants to specifically interact with a peptide containing a pSer-X-X-Phe motif, a known functional target of the BRCA1 BRCT domain. Finally, we used transcriptional assays to assess the ability of each BRCT variant to act as a transcriptional activation domain in human cells. Through a correlation of the assay results with available family history and clinical data, we define limits to predict the disease risk associated with each variant. Forty-two of the variants show little effect on function and are likely to represent variants with little or no clinical significance; 50 display a clear functional effect and are likely to represent pathogenic variants; and the remaining 25 variants display intermediate activities. The excellent agreement between the structure/function effects of these mutations and available clinical data supports the notion that functional and structure information can be useful in the development of models to assess cancer risk. Introduction Since the cloning of BRCA1 in 1994, a large effort has been made to sequence the BRCA1 genes of women who are at increased risk for early-onset breast and ovarian cancers (1).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript This effort has revealed several mutations that are strongly linked to cancer. Unfortunately, a large number of rare BRCA1 variants have been uncovered in the human population for which risk assessment has been problematic, due to a lack of informative pedigree data linking each mutation with disease risk. BRCA1 encodes a large, 1,863–amino acid nuclear protein that plays a critical role in the response of cells to genotoxic stress (2–4). BRCA1 is thought to act as an essential mediator protein in DNA damage–induced nuclear signaling events, in which it interacts with phosphorylated partner proteins such as the DNA helicase, BACH1, the nuclease CtIP, and another signaling protein, Abraxas, to relay signals generated from chromatin surrounding the damage to downstream targets such as DNA repair proteins and factors involved in cell cycle regulation (5–11). Interactions with phosphorylated partner proteins are mediated by a tandem pair of repeats at the COOH terminus of BRCA1, termed BRCT repeats (12–14). The BRCT repeat region can also act as a transcriptional activation domain when linked to a sequence-specific DNA binding module, and this activity may contribute to the ability of BRCA1 to regulate the expression of genes such as p21 and GADD45 (15,16) and modulate the activity of other transcription factors such as p53 and ER (17,18). The NH2-terminal region of the protein contains a RING domain, which forms a heterodimeric complex with the RING domain of BARD1 to form a ubiquitin ligase (19–21). Cancer-associated mutations tend to cluster in the RING and BRCT repeat regions, showing the critical role of these domains in BRCA1 tumor suppression. The BRCA1 BRCT domain specifically interacts with phosphorylated protein targets containing the motif pSer-x-x-Phe. Structural studies have revealed that recognition involves a conserved phosphoserine recognition pocket in the NH2-terminal BRCT repeat, composed of Ser1655, Gly1656, and Lys1702, which each supply ligands to recognize the phosphate (12–14). The phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the peptide target is recognized by a largely hydrophobic groove formed at the interface between the repeats. Phosphopeptide recognition is likely a common function of BRCT domains in many proteins associated with DNA damage–mediated signal transduction. For example, the phosphorylated form of the histone variant, H2AX, which serves as a critical chromatin mark of DNA double-strand breaks, is specifically bound by the tandem BRCT repeats of MDC1 to initiate DNA doublestrand break signaling (22,23). Several studies have attempted to predict the cancer risks associated with unclassified missense variants in BRCA1 through bioinformatics analysis based on multiple sequence alignment data and protein structure prediction, as well as analyses of the clinical and family history data available for some of these mutations (1,24–28). These studies indicate that the RING and BRCT domains, which are the most highly conserved regions of BRCA1, likely contain the vast majority of cancer-associated mutations. Here, we use in vitro protein folding, phosphopeptide-binding, and cell-based transcriptional assays to assess the structural and functional consequences of a set of 117 distinct missense variants that have been uncovered in the BRCA1 BRCT domain in the human population. Our results indicate that nearly one half of the BRCT missense variants result in significant structural and/or functional defects that are likely associated with an increased cancer risk. Materials and Methods Proteolysis assays pLM1 plasmid (0.25 μg) encoding the BRCT variants was used directly as template for protein synthesis reactions with the TNT-Quick in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). Both wild-type and mutant proteins were produced by in vitro transcription/ translation because many mutants could not be expressed in soluble form in Escherichia coli. The stability of the protein fold for the BRCA1 BRCT mutants was tested using Lee et al. Page 2 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript proteolysis assays, as previously reported (29). The measurements were normalized against the internal background, and the control measurements taken in the same day. The missense variants were tested in triplicate. Phosphopeptide-binding assays The BRCT variants were translated and labeled as in proteolysis assays. The ability of the BRCA1 BRCT mutants to bind pSer-containing peptides was tested using peptide-binding assays, as previously reported (14). Bead-immobilized peptide affinity resin was prepared by incubating a 10-fold molar excess of a biotinylated phosphopeptide (SRSTpSPTFNK) and the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (SRSTSPTFNK) with streptavidin agarose beads (SigmaAldrich). Seven mutants, with the wild-type BRCA1-BRCT (1,646–1,858) as a positive control, and M1775R and A1708E as negative controls were examined at a time. The intensities of the bands were measured and the backgrounds were corrected using ImageQuaNT (Amersham Biosciences), and the measurements were normalized against the wild-type measurement taken in the same day. The missense variants were tested in triplicate. Transcriptional assays The construct containing wild-type BRCA1 amino acids 1,646 to 1,859 (wt) was used as a positive control and variants M1775R and Y1853X as negative controls. HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates, 1 × 105  cells per well, and 24 hours later were transfected in triplicates with Fugene 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). The vectors containing the variants were cotransfected with pG5Luc, which contains a firefly luciferase reporter gene driven by GAL4-responsive binding sites, and phGR-TK, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by a constitutive TK basal promoter used as an internal control. Cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Activity was plotted as a percentage of the wt BRCA1 activity. Thirty-four of 117 variants had already been assessed in previous articles, albeit in different amino acid contexts (amino acids 1,396–1863 or aa 1,560–1863; refs. 30–32). In only one case (G1706A), the qualitative assessment differed because it was considered of moderate effect previously and of no effect in the present study. This shows the high reproducibility of the transcriptional assays. Align-GVGD classification of BRCA1 BRCT variants The 117 BRCT variants were analyzed with the Align-GVGD algorithm at three depths of alignment. Nine mammalian BRCA1 sequences, chicken and one additional sequence (either frog, puffer fish, or sea urchin), were used for the alignment (for more detail, see ref. 33). A-class scores were assigned for variants in which the scores from at least two of three alignments agreed. Definition of a validation set To compile our validation set (Supplementary Table S1; Table 1), we identified variants that had been previously analyzed and classified by genetic (1) or integrative methods (25, 34– 40). Integrative methods use a combination of data from different sources, including cooccurrence with known deleterious mutations, personal and family history of patients carrying the variant, and cosegregation of the variant with disease within pedigrees, to assign an overall risk score. Sufficient data were available to assign 14 of the BRCA1 BRCT variants as associated with disease, whereas 10 of the variants were predicted to be neutral Lee et al. Page 3 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript (Table 1). Where possible, the probability of pathogenicity of each of these variants was classified according to the IARC scheme (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 41). We calculated specificity, sensitivity, and 95% confidence interval measures for each of the structure and functional assays based on a comparison with this variant set (Supplementary Table S2). A description of how the BRCA1 BRCT variant set was obtained is given in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Results Generation of a large set of BRCA1 BRCT missense variants Many of the BRCA1 variants that have been uncovered through worldwide sequencing efforts are now deposited within the Breast Cancer Information Core database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/) as well as the Kathleen Cuningham Foundation Consortium for research into Familial Breast Cancer database (http://www.kconfab.org). To facilitate the assessment of the structural and functional defects associated with these mutations, we cloned all the currently available missense variants (Fig. 1) into an E. coli expression vector that we used previously for our structural and functional work of the BRCA1 BRCT domain. This vector places the BRCA1 BRCT coding sequence (corresponding to residues 1,646–1,859) under control of a T7 promotor. Using this plasmid system, recombinant protein can be expressed in E. coli and purified using established procedures for detailed biochemical and structural studies. The T7 promoter can also be used for in vitro transcription/translation of the recombinant protein. The in vitro transcription/translation system is rapid and allows the generation of multiple proteins in parallel and, because the recombinant protein is specifically labeled with 35S-methionine, no purification is required. All variants can be successfully made in this system, regardless of their folding stability. This is a further advantage over E. coli expression, in which we have found that only well-folded variants can be expressed in soluble form and purified. Thus, we have used in vitro transcribed/translated material for our structural stability and peptidebinding assays described below. We also evaluated the possibility that some of these variants could result in splicing abnormalities. We used the NNSplice 0.9 algorithm (42) to predict the effects of these changes on the efficiency with the BRCT coding region (see Supplementary Materials). Determination of the protein folding defects associated with BRCT missense variants We used limited proteolysis to determine the stability of the protein fold in the set of BRCA1 BRCT missense variants using in vitro transcribed/translated material (Supplementary Fig. S1). The wild-type protein is highly resistant to digestion by trypsin, elastase, or chymotrypsin, indicating that the in vitro produced BRCT protein is stably folded (43). On the other hand, a pilot study involving 25 of the BRCA1 BRCT missense variants showed that certain single amino acid substitutions in the BRCT domain of BRCA1 can destabilize its structure, leading to increased susceptibility to trypsin-mediated proteolysis (29). The assay is sufficiently sensitive to discriminate wild-type protein from the strongly destabilized variant A1708E as well as the moderately destabilized variant M1775R. Proteolysis of each of the missense variants was carried out at a series of trypsin concentrations, and the amount of full-length protein remaining was visualized by SDSPAGE. The results were compared with those of the wild-type protein as well as the M1775R and A1708E variants carried out in parallel. We quantified the percentages of fulllength protein remaining following digestion at different concentrations of trypsin and determined the severity of the destabilizing effects by comparing the percentage of protein remaining following digestion at 10 μg/mL trypsin to the controls (Supplementary Fig. S2A). We defined highly destabilizing mutations as those with similar rates of digestion to Lee et al. Page 4 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript the A1708E control (<5% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 μg/mL of trypsin). Moderately destabilizing mutations were defined as those with a similar stability to M1775R (between 5% and 65% of the protein remaining after digestion with 10 μg/mL of trypsin). Finally, structurally stable variants were defined as those with a stability similar to the wild-type protein (>65% of the protein remaining after 10 μg/mL of trypsin digestion). Based on these criteria, 26 of 117 of the missense mutations showed high sensitivity to tryptic digestion; 30 of 117 showed intermediate sensitivity; and 61 of 117 showed a stability that was indistinguishable from the wild-type (Supplementary Figs. S2A and S3). We also noted that the C1697R mutant showed a particularly low protein expression level. Analysis of the phosphopeptide binding activity of BRCT missense variants The BRCA1 BRCT domain interacts with BACH1 and several other proteins through the selective recognition of the peptide motif pSer-x-x-Phe (10–14,44). All mutations that have been strongly linked to disease using family-based data, such as A1708E and M1775R (1,35), fail to bind specifically to pSer-x-x-Phe–containing peptides as shown in a pilot study that analyzed the peptide binding activities of 25 BRCA1 BRCT domain variants (14). This indicates the functional importance of the BRCA1 BRCT domain as a phosphopeptidebinding module in tumor suppression. We examined the ability of the BRCT domains containing missense variants to bind peptides derived from BACH1 using a pull-down assay in which biotinylated peptide was bound to streptavidin beads. We tested binding to a phosphorylated version of the peptide containing the BRCA1 target sequence pSer-Pro-Thr-Phe or an unphosphorylated version as a control. The results were compared with experiments with the wild-type BRCA1 BRCT as well as with the peptide binding–deficient variants A1708E and M1775R carried out in parallel. We present two analyses of the data. In the first analysis, we define “binding activity” as the fraction of the input protein that bound to the phosphorylated peptide, normalized against the binding of the wild-type protein (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In the second analysis, we define “binding specificity” as the ratio of the variant bound to the phosphopeptide compared with the nonphosphorylated counterpart, normalized to the wildtype control (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Classified in this way, we observed a range of binding activities and specificities. As observed for the protein stability assays, the variants tended to cluster near either 100% or 0% activity, with relatively few variants displaying intermediate binding activities/specificities (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thirty-eight of 117 of the variants displayed binding activities >80% of wild-type levels, whereas 35 of 117 variants displayed binding activities <20% of wild-type. The binding specificity analysis revealed 29 of 117 of the variants exhibited >80% of wild-type levels, whereas 50 of 117 of the variants exhibited <20% of wild-type levels. Analysis of the transcriptional activation activity of BRCA1 BRCT variants The transcriptional activation activity of the BRCA1 BRCT domain was the first identified activity of this region of the protein (15,16). Assays for BRCA1 BRCT transcriptional activation have been established in human and yeast cell systems (45). In either method, the BRCT domain is fused to a heterologous DNA binding domain that recognizes a defined regulatory sequence within the promoter of the reporter. Pilot studies involving subsets of the BRCA1 BRCT variants showed that mutations that have been associated with cancer using family-based data abrogate, or markedly diminish, the expression of the reporter gene (31,32,46). Moreover, the fact that mutations that destabilize the BRCT fold are strongly associated with a loss of transactivation function indicates that this assay is a monitor of the integrity of the BRCT domain (29). Lee et al. Page 5 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript As observed for the protein stability and phosphopeptide-binding assays, a wide range of transcriptional activities were observed for the variant set, with the observed values tending to cluster either at very low or very high activity levels (Supplementary Figs. S2D and S3). Thirty-eight of 117 variants displayed transcriptional activity levels at >80% of wild-type, whereas 54 of 117 were found to be <20% of wild-type levels. Correlation of structural and functional data with family history and clinical data The use of functional data in cancer risk assessment is predicated on rigorous validation of the results against sets of variants for which cancer risks are well defined. Easton and colleagues (35) have assigned risks based on genetic data for a large number of BRCA1 variants. We used these data, together with available genetic information for several other variants (25,34–40), to create a validation set of 24 variants, consisting of 14 deleterious mutations and 10 neutral variants (Table 1). We plotted the protein stability, peptide binding, and transcriptional activity data against the combined log10 likelihood ratio scores for the subset of 19 variants analyzed by Easton and colleagues (Fig. 2; likelihood ratio). In general, this analysis revealed a clear correlation between structural/functional defects and cancer risk (35). A comparison of all the genetically characterized variants with the experimental results is shown in Table 1. This comparison was used to define the sensitivities and specificities of the functional assays. Sensitivity ranged from 81.8% for phosphopeptide binding activity to 100% for phosphopeptide binding specificity and transcription assays. Specificity ranged from 75% for proteolysis assays to 87.5% for transcription assays, to 100% for binding activity assays (Supplementary Table S2). Although overall there is a good agreement between the assessed cancer risks and the functional activities of the variants, there are several variants in which cancer risk assessment and the structure/function results do not agree. For example, a significant number of cancer-associated (IARC classes 5 and 4) variants are not structurally destabilized as determined by the proteolysis assay. Each of these variants (R1699W, M1775R, and M1775K) is highly defective for specific phosphopeptide recognition and transcriptional activity. Structural studies reveal that both Arg1699 and Met1775 make critical direct contacts to the phosphopeptide (12–14), and structural investigations of the M1775R and M1775K variants reveal subtle structural rearrangements that block the +3 specificity pocket (37,47). Two of the cancer-associated (IARC class 5) variants, I1766S and G1788V, were highly defective in the proteolysis and transcriptional assays; however, they showed significant levels of nonspecific peptide binding, independent of phosphorylation. It is likely that the unfolded state of these variants exposes hydrophobic residues that are responsible for these nonspecific interactions, as suggested previously (14). G1706E, one of the cancer-associated (IARC class 5) variants, is defective in the proteolysis and peptidebinding assays; however, it shows an intermediate level of transcriptional activity. The neutral (IARC class 1) variant V1736A exhibited the least agreement between the different assays, showing significant sensitivity to proteolysis and a strong transcriptional defect while showing intermediate/strong levels of phosphopeptide interaction. Considering the overall high specificity and sensitivity obtained in the assays (Supplementary Table S2), we have defined limits to predict disease association for the uncharacterized variants based on the biochemical and transcriptional assay data (Table 1; Fig. 2). It is important to stress that the definition of these limits should not be used for classifying variants in terms of their pathogenicity in the absence of additional data. The cancer-associated (IARC classes 5 and 4) variants in general exhibited protein stability levels <58% of the wild-type, phosphopeptide binding activities <32% of wild-type, phosphopeptide specificity binding activities <21% of wild-type, and transcriptional activation function <35% of wild-type levels. Conversely, the neutral variants (IARC classes 1 and 2) in general had protein stability levels >59% of the wild-type, phosphopeptide Lee et al. Page 6 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript binding activities >67% of wild-type, phosphopeptide specificity binding activities >49% of wild-type, and transcriptional activation function >76% of wild-type levels. Variants falling between these limits are defined as uncertain. Using these limits, we have defined the structure and functional activities of each of the variants (Fig. 3). Comparison of results from different assays and overall classification Next, we compared the results from the different assays for the entire set of variants (Fig. 3). In 64 of 117 (54.7%) of the variants, there was complete concordance between the different assays, with 35 of 117 (29.9%) giving protein stability, peptide binding, and transcription activities within the limits that correspond to neutral variants in IARC classes 1 and 2, whereas 29 of 117 (24.8%) exhibited values in the range corresponding to cancer-associated (IARC classes 4 and 5) variants for each of the assays. Based on these results, we have classified the variants into groups based on their functional effect (Table 2). Although classification is straightforward for those variants in which there is a complete agreement between the different assays, for the variants in which there is not a complete agreement, classification is more complex. The largest class of discordant results includes variants that exhibit defects in binding and transcription but little or no folding defect (6 of 117 variants or 5.1%). These variants likely directly affect the phosphopeptide binding surface and may only affect residues that are exposed to the solvent preserving the overall fold structure. Because phosphopeptide recognition is critical for the tumorsuppressive function of BRCA1 (14,48), we have therefore included these variants in the strong functional effect class. Likewise, severely destabilized variants that show significant levels of phosphorylation-independent peptide binding but a strong transcriptional defect have also been categorized as strong functional effect (Table 2). We have also described eight of the variants as of “moderate functional effect” in which a preponderance of the data points to a loss of function. These include variants with intermediate levels of peptide binding specificity (W1837G and A1843P) or transcriptional activity (V1696L, G1706E, and H1746N), and strong defects in all of the other assays. In addition, we have included three additional mutants in this group that show poor agreement between the different assays but are likely to directly affect the peptide-binding surface. S1655F is predicted to impede recognition of the phosphoserine in the bound peptide, whereas G1656D could perturb the structure of the phosphoserine-binding pocket, and the introduction of a negatively charged side chain in this region would be expected to further inhibit phosphopeptide recognition. R1699L would remove a critical determinant for recognition of the phenylalanine residue at the +3 position of the phosphopeptide, and indeed, the similar R1699W variant is pathogenic (IARC class 5; Table 1). We predict a given variant to be neutral when each of the assays gives values similar to wild-type within the limits defined by comparison with the set of variants that have been characterized through family history and genetic data. In addition, we define a set of seven variants as “low functional effect” that display an intermediate activity for one of the assays and wild-type levels for the other three. Finally, there is a group of 25 variants (21.4%) that we define as “uncertain.” In general, these variants show a poor level of agreement between the different assays, and a significant number of assay results in the intermediate range. Correlation of mutant classification with predictions from Align-GVGD The Align-GVGD method (http://agvgd.iarc.fr/agvgd_input.php) uses protein multiple sequence alignment (PMSA) data to provide cancer risk estimates for BRCA1 mutations (33). In this method, each missense variant is classified based on the observed amino acid Lee et al. Page 7 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript fluctuation at that position in the PMSA (the Grantham variance, GV) as well as a comparison of the amino acid substitution with the range of amino acids observed at that position (Grantham difference, GD). In this way, seven classes of variants (C0, C15, C25, C35, C45, C55, and C65) that represent a graded series of GV-GD scores were defined. Variants in the C0 class correspond to variants that are well conserved in the PMSA and are therefore predicted to be neutral, whereas the C65 class contains missense variants that deviate from the PMSA and likely associated with an increased cancer risk. To assess the accuracy of the Align GV-GD method, we compared Align GV-GD scores to the results for the structure/function assays (Fig. 4). For the variants with no functional effect, a large majority (28 of 35, 80%) falls into the C0 class, three are classified as C15, and two are classified as C25. Only one of them, G1706A, received a high score in Align GV-GD, C55. Another variant at this position (G1706E) scored as C65, but this variant was classified with moderate functional effect by structure/function assays. These results suggest substitution of a small side chain at position 1,706 is tolerated, but not substitution of the larger, charged Glu. For the variants with strong functional effect, 25 of 42 (59.5%) are in the C65 class and 16 are spread throughout classes C15 to C55 (Fig. 4B). One missense variant (A1752P) was classified C0, but this variant shows strong defect in all assays. The substitution of a proline at position 1,752 likely destabilizes the linker α-helix, which may be responsible for the strong folding defect associated with this variant. Overall, there is strong agreement between Align GV-GD predictions and the results of functional assays, indicating that sequence alignment–based predictive methods can offer a valuable measure of risk assessment for variants in which there is no direct functional data. Discussion Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of the structural and functional consequences of 117 BRCA1 variants corresponding to the complete set of BRCT missense variants detected to date in the human population (100% coverage). Our protein structure assay, peptide binding, and transcriptional assays show a remarkable degree of agreement and give us confidence in the validity of these results. Correlation of this experimental data with the available clinical and family history data for a subset of these variants defines limits that can be used to tentatively predict functional effect that is likely to be reflected in the disease risk associated with these variants. In this way, we show that 42.7% of the variants fall into the “clear functional effect” or “moderate functional effect” categories (Table 2) and are likely associated with an increased cancer risk, whereas 35.9% fall into the “no functional effect” or “low functional effect” categories. The remaining 21.4% falls into the uncertain category and could perhaps represent low-penetrance variants. The fact that a large proportion of variants tested displayed some functional effect lends support to the idea of applying higher prior probabilities for causality to variants found in the BRCT domains (35). The BRCA1 BRCT variant set provides a useful set of reagents for further detailed study of variants of particular interest. For example, variants that are moderately well folded based on proteolytic stability can often be purified and studied in more detail. Circular dicroism spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to quantitatively assess the fold stability of V1696L, R1699W, M1775K, M1775R, M1783T, V1808A, V1809F, and V1833M (49–51). Although our proteolytic assay indicated that the stability of two of these variants, R1699W and V1808A, were indistinguishable from wild-type, the more sensitive thermodynamic studies of the purified forms of these variants reveal a small but significant reduction in fold stability. In addition, quantitative assays of phosphopeptide binding, such as isothermal titration calorimetry, can reveal the detailed thermodynamics of peptide-BRCT interactions (50,51). The structural rearrangements induced by three of these variants, M1775R (47), M1775K (37), and V1809F (14), have been visualized through Lee et al. Page 8 Cancer Res. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 June 15. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript crystallographic structural analysis. Each of the variants affect the +3 specificity pocket formed at the interface between the two BRCT repeats. For M1775R and M1775K, the substituted positively charged side chain adopts an orientation that fills the specificity pocket and blocks the binding of the Phe side chain at the +3 position of the target peptide. Intriguingly, the V1809F substitution, which occurs far from the +3 pocket, induces a series of conformational adjustments that results in the movement of Met1775 to fill the specificity pocket, explaining the loss of peptide binding specificity and transcriptional activity associated with this variant. Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) that lead to amino acid substitutions are likely to have diverse phenotypic consequences and implications for human disease. Although computational methods have been proposed to assess the effect of individual SNPs (52), relatively little has been done at the experimental level to provide insight into the effects of SNPs. The database of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations provides an important first look at the kind of genetic diversity that exists in the human population. Another example of a large mutation database is that assembled for mutations found in p53 from human tumors. Detailed studies of the stability of the p53 DNA binding domain indicate that, like the BRCA1 BRCT domain, this relatively unstable domain is sensitive to mutations that destabilize the protein fold in addition to other classes of mutations that do not significantly affect protein fold stability but instead modify DNA-binding or proteinprotein interaction surfaces (53). Thus, rapid, general assays of protein structure and function such as the proteolysis assay used here could potentially prove useful for the rapid, high-throughput assessment of the effect of SNPs on protein function. Ultimately, unambiguous classification of variants, as proposed by the IARC Unclassified Genetic variants Working Group (41), will need a comprehensive integrative model to incorporate data from several sources. Robust integrative models have been proposed but they still lack a coherent framework to incorporate functional data. A major roadblock in the development of such a model was the lack of an established series of functional assays with standardized controls, validated against available genetic data. The present study fills this gap and allows for the development of better predictive models. Although a systematic large-scale classification of all BRCA1 variants into the IARC classes has not yet been done, it is expected that a large number will fall into class 3 (uncertain), due to the lack of genetic-based data. Conceivably, even large-scale efforts may not be able to gather sufficient genetic data on individual variants because most are extremely rare. Thus, we anticipate that the use of structural and functional information will be instrumental to move variants from the class 3 into classes that provide a basis for better risk assessment and clinical decisions. In addition, the fact that variants can now also be functionally and structurally rationalized will provide an impulse for further functional dissection of the tumor-suppressive activities of BRCA1.



       "The activities of cyclin D-dependent kinases serve to integrate extracellular signaling during G1 phase with the cell-cycle engine that regulates DNA replication and mitosis. Induction of D-type cyclins and their assembly into holoenzyme complexes depend on mitogen stimulation. Conversely, the fact that D-type cyclins are labile proteins guarantees that the subunit pool shrinks rapidly when cells are deprived of mitogens. Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on a single threonine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Thr-286) positively regulates proteasomal degradation of D1. Now, we demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylates cyclin D1 specifically on Thr-286, thereby triggering rapid cyclin D1 turnover. Because the activity of GSK-3β can be inhibited by signaling through a pathway that sequentially involves Ras, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase B (Akt), the turnover of cyclin D1, like its assembly, is also Ras dependent and, hence, mitogen regulated. In contrast, Ras mutants defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase (MEK1) mutants that act downstream of Ras to activate extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs), cannot stabilize cyclin D1. In direct contrast to cyclin D1, which accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase and exits into the cytoplasm during S phase, GSK-3β is predominantly cytoplasmic during G1 phase, but a significant fraction enters the nucleus during S phase. A highly stable D1 mutant in which an alanine is substituted for the threonine at position 286 and that is refractory to phosphorylation by GSK-3β remained in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle. Overexpression of an active, but not a kinase-defective, form of GSK-3β in mouse fibroblasts caused a redistribution of cyclin D1 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm. Therefore, phosphorylation and proteolytic turnover of cyclin D1 and its subcellular localization during the cell division cycle are linked through the action of GSK-3β.  Keywords: Glycogen synthase kinase-3, cyclin D1, Ras signaling, proteolysis, nuclear transport A family of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) cooperatively regulates mammalian cell cycle progression (for review, see Sherr 1993). During G1 phase, D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) are synthesized and assemble with either CDK4 or CDK6 in response to growth factor stimulation, thereby generating active holoenzymes that help inactivate the growth-suppressive function of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) through its phosphorylation (for review, see Weinberg 1995). Cyclin D holoenzyme complexes also titrate CDK inhibitors, such as p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, facilitating the activation of cyclin E-CDK2 and subsequent entry into the DNA synthetic phase of the cell cycle (for review, see Sherr and Roberts 1995).  Ras-mediated pathways are important for cyclin D1 induction and its assembly with CDKs. Overexpression of activated oncogenic Ras alleles, but not wild-type Ras, initiates DNA synthesis independently of growth factor stimulation (Feramisco et al. 1984). Conversely, microinjection of antibodies that inactivate Ras or introduction of certain dominant-negative Ras alleles can block S-phase entry induced by mitogens (Mulcahy et al. 1985; Mittnacht et al. 1997; Peeper et al. 1997). Both cyclin D1 expression and assembly require the sequential activities of Raf1, mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinases (MEK1 and MEK2), and the sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs; Albanese et al. 1995; Lavoie et al. 1996; Winston et al. 1996; Aktas et al. 1997; Kerkhoff and Rapp 1997; Weber et al. 1997; Cheng et al. 1998).  In turn, cyclin D1 degradation is mediated by phosphorylation-triggered, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (Diehl et al. 1997). Polyubiquitination of protein substrates involves the sequential action of three distinct enzymes termed E1, E2 (UBC; ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase; Ciechanover 1994; King et al. 1996). Specificity of substrate recognition is dependent on several factors including E2 and E3 selectivity (King et al. 1996; Skowyra et al. 1997; Renny-Feldman et al. 1997), recognition motifs within the target proteins themselves (Glotzer et al. 1991), and, in some cases, a requirement for phosphorylation of specific residues within the substrate (Deshaies et al. 1995; Clurman et al. 1996; Lanker et al. 1996; Won et al. 1996). Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue (Thr-286) located near the protein carboxyl terminus, and this phosphorylation is not mediated by cyclin D-dependent kinases themselves (Diehl et al. 1997). Because the kinase that phosphorylates this residue has not yet been identified, it remains unclear whether cyclin D1 proteolysis, like its synthesis and assembly, is subject to mitogen regulation.  The subcellular distribution of D-type cyclins is also likely to be regulated by cell cycle-dependent events. Cyclin D1 accumulates in the nuclei of cells during G1 phase, but once DNA replication begins, it disappears from the nucleus (Baldin et al. 1993), despite the fact that its level of synthesis does not decrease markedly during S phase (Matsushime et al. 1991). The mechanisms that regulate the periodic subcellular redistribution of cyclin D1 during the cell division cycle have also not been defined.  We now demonstrate that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) catalyzes the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286, thereby regulating cyclin D1 turnover in response to mitogenic signals. In turn, GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1 redirects the protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Our results support a model in which phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286 by GSK-3β links processes governing cyclin D1 subcellular localization with its proteasomal degradation.  Go to: Results GSK-3β phosphorylates cyclin D1 on Thr-286 in vitro  Rapid turnover of cyclin D1 requires phosphorylation of Thr-286 (Diehl et al. 1997), and its location adjacent to Pro-287 suggested that this modification might be mediated by a proline-directed kinase. Hence, we tested several known proline-directed kinases including GSK-3β, ERK2, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK, p54β1), and cyclin E–CDK2 (Fig. (Fig.1)1) for their ability to phosphorylate cyclin D1 on Thr-286. Previous work from our laboratory indicated that cyclin D1–CDK4 complexes expressed in mammalian cells were better substrates than D1 subunits alone (also see below). To prepare substrate, we expressed Flag epitope-tagged cyclin D1 in insect Sf9 cells together with a catalytically inactive mutant (K35M) of CDK4 and recovered both free and CDK4-bound D1 subunits with M2 monoclonal antibodies to the Flag tag. Kinase reactions performed in vitro demonstrated that purified GSK-3β efficiently phosphorylated wild-type cyclin D1 (Fig. (Fig.1A,1A, lane 1), but not a cyclin D1 mutant containing an Ala for Thr-286 substitution [D1-(T286A), lane 2]. In contrast, ERK2 (lanes 3,4), SAPK (lanes 5,6), and cyclin E–CDK2 (lanes 7,8) all failed to phosphorylate cyclin D1, although each of the enzyme preparations was highly active on other substrates (data not shown).  Figure 1 Figure 1 GSK-3β phosphorylates cyclin D1 on Thr-286. (A) Cyclin D1 (odd lanes) or cyclin D1-(T286A) (even lanes) immunoprecipitated from Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding D1 and CDK4 were mixed with recombinant GSK-3β (lanes 1,2), ... To confirm that the site of GSK-3β phosphorylation was Thr-286, radiolabeled cyclin D1 was electrophoretically separated on a denaturing gel, transferred to membrane, and digested with trypsin. Labeled peptides were sequentially separated in two dimensions by electrophoresis and ascending chromatography (Fig. (Fig.1B).1B). The tryptic fingerprint derived from GSK-3β-phosphorylated cyclin D1 (left panel) revealed a single characteristic phosphopeptide. This peptide, previously designated A, appeared qualitatively similar to the major phosphopeptide derived from cyclin D1 phosphorylated in Sf9 cells (middle panel), which we know contains Thr-286, the only site of cyclin D1 threonine phosphorylation (Diehl et al. 1997). Mixing of these two phosphopeptides confirmed that they had indistinguishable mobilities in both dimensions (right panel). Therefore, GSK-3β can specifically phosphorylate cyclin D1 on Thr-286 in vitro.  To compare phosphorylation of cyclin D1 and D1–CDK4 complexes, Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding cyclin D1 alone or cyclin D1 together with CDK4 in the presence or absence of GSK-3β, and infected cells were metabolically labeled with 32P-orthophosphate. Free cyclin D1 was isolated by direct precipitation with a monoclonal antibody directed against D1 itself (Fig. (Fig.2A,2A, lanes 2,3), while cyclin D1 bound to CDK4 was isolated by precipitation with antiserum to the carboxyl terminus of CDK4 (Fig. (Fig.2A,2A, lanes 4,5). Under conditions such as those used here in which CDK4 and cyclin D1 are expressed at similar levels, factors mediating their assembly in Sf9 cells are limiting and only about 10%–20% of the D1 molecules form binary complexes with the catalytic subunits (Kato et al. 1994). Therefore, lysates were normalized to yield roughly equivalent levels of D1 in each lane (bottom panel). In the absence of exogenous GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.2A,2A, lanes 2,4), both free cyclin D1 and CDK4-bound cyclin D1 were phosphorylated by endogenous insect kinases. Much of this background phosphorylation occurs on Thr-286 (Fig. (Fig.1B,1B, middle) with the remainder occurring on multiple serine residues (requiring longer autoradiographic exposures to visualize). As shown previously, the introduction of CDK4 resulted in increased cyclin D1 phosphorylation (Fig. (Fig.2A,2A, lane 4 vs. lane 2) on both Thr-286 and serine residues (Kato et al. 1994; Diehl et al. 1997). Coinfection with baculovirus encoding GSK-3β resulted in a further threefold increase in phosphorylation of CDK4-bound cyclin D1 (cf. lanes 5 and 4) without significantly affecting phosphorylation of unbound cyclin D1 (lane 3 vs. 2). Mapping of tryptic phosphopeptides again confirmed increased phosphorylation of D1 only on Thr-286. Therefore, the cyclin D1–CDK4 complex is a better substrate of GSK-3β than free cyclin D1.  Figure 2 Figure 2 GSK-3β binds to D1 subunits and preferentially phosphorylates cyclin D1 in complexes with CDK4. (A) Sf9 cells infected with baculoviruses encoding cyclin D1 or cyclin D1 plus CDK4 with or without wild-type GSK-3β as indicated were metabolically ... We also tested whether a kinase-defective GSK-3β mutant could inhibit phosphorylation of cyclin D1 in intact Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding cyclin D1 and CDK4 together with different combinations of wild-type and kinase-defective GSK-3β. Infected cells were labeled with 32P-orthophosphate and cyclin D1 was isolated by immunoprecipitation (Fig. (Fig.2B).2B). Cyclin D1 was again phosphorylated by endogenous insect kinases (Fig. (Fig.2B,2B, lane 2), but expression of kinase-defective GSK-3β reduced background phosphorylation of cyclin D1 about fivefold (cf. lanes 2 and 3). As before, expression of wild-type GSK-3β with cyclin D1 induced an increase in cyclin D1 phosphorylation over background (cf. lanes 2 and 5). However, kinase-defective GSK-3β again interfered with D1 phosphorylation (lane 4 vs. 5), reducing it to a level below background (lane 4 vs. lane 2). Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis once again confirmed that GSK-3β phosphorylation occurred on Thr-286 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that mutant kinase-defective GSK-3β can dampen phosphorylation of D1 by the wild-type form of the enzyme, as well as by endogenous D1 kinase(s) expressed in Sf9 cells.  One possible explanation of the latter results is that GSK-3β can interact stably with the cyclin D1–CDK4 complex directly and that binding of the kinase-defective mutant form of the enzyme occludes phosphorylation by the catalytically active form. Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses encoding cyclin D1, CDK4, and either wild-type or kinase-defective GSK-3β, and lysate proteins precipitated with nonimmune rabbit serum (NRS) or with antisera to GSK-3β, cyclin D1, or CDK4 were separated on denaturing gels and blotted with antibodies to GSK-3β (Fig (Fig2C).2C). Both baculovirus-encoded forms of GSK-3β were precipitated with the cognate antibody (lanes 5,7), whereas no endogenous form of the enzyme was recovered from uninfected insect cells (lane 3). A small but significant fraction of wild-type GSK-3β (estimated at 3%–5% in several such experiments) was coprecipitated with antibodies to cyclin D1 (lanes 4 vs. lane 5), and, surprisingly, almost half of the catalytically inactive form of the enzyme became stably associated with the cyclin (lanes 6,7). This suggested that phosphorylation of D1 by GSK-3β might destabilize the interaction, and consistent with this idea, removal of ATP from lysates containing wild-type GSK-3β by dialysis followed by addition of nonhydrolyzable ATP increased by threefold the level of wild-type GSK-3β coprecipitating with anti-D1 (data not shown). Catalytically inactive GSK-3β could not associate with CDK4 subunits alone (lanes 8,9) but did coprecipitate with unbound cyclin D1 subunits (lanes 10,11). Despite the ability of kinase-defective GSK-3β to bind free D1 subunits, D1–CDK4 complexes are the preferred substrate of wild-type GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.2A).2A). Therefore, kinase-defective GSK-3β can interact with free or CDK4-bound cyclin D1 and forms more stable complexes than its wild-type counterpart, consistent with the ability of the mutant form to interfere with D1 Thr-286 phosphorylation by catalytically active GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.22B).  GSK-3β is a major cyclin D1 kinase in lysates of mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts  To verify that GSK-3β recovered from mammalian cells would also specifically phosphorylate cyclin D1 on Thr-286 in vitro, endogenous GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated from NIH-3T3 cell lysates, and recovered immune complexes were incubated in kinase reactions with GST–D1 fusion proteins plus [γ-32P]ATP. In an attempt to avoid complications of contamination of immune precipitates with adventitious serine kinases, we used fusion protein substrates containing only the carboxy-terminal 41 amino acids of cyclin D1. This D1 domain contains only two serine residues at codons 257 and 258 and two threonines at codons 286 and 288; as a control, we used a GST–D1 fusion protein containing the T286A mutation.  GST–D1 was efficiently phosphorylated by GSK-3β-containing immune complexes recovered from NIH-3T3 cells, but GST–D1–(T286A) was not (Fig. (Fig.3A,3A, lanes 2,3). Immune complexes collected with NRS (lane 1) did not phosphorylate GST–D1. NIH-3T3 cells were lysed and subjected to two rounds of immunodepletion with either a control monoclonal antibody (9E10) or with the antibody to GSK-3β and depletion of GSK-3β was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). When GST–D1 or GST–D1–(T286A) was added to the GSK-3β-depleted or mock-depleted lysates together with [γ-32P]ATP, both fusion proteins still underwent phosphorylation (data not shown). Because both fusion proteins contain other serine and threonine residues, their phosphorylation by kinases remaining in the lysates would likely obscure phosphorylation of Thr-286. Therefore, we prephosphorylated the fusion proteins with purified protein kinase A (PKA) in reactions performed with unlabeled ATP. Thr-286 does not fall into a PKA consensus site and should not be modified. Following removal of PKA by repurification of the fusion proteins, the ability of the immunodepleted extracts to phosphorylate GST–D1 or GST–D1-(T286A) was reassessed. Under these conditions, GST–D1 was efficiently phosphorylated by the mock-depleted lysate (Fig. (Fig.3B,3B, lane 1), but depletion of GSK-3β reduced phosphorylation of GST–D1 by >90% (lane 3). GST–D1-(T286A) was not phosphorylated by either lysate (lanes 2,4). Therefore, GSK-3β is a major enzyme in NIH-3T3 cells that is able to catalyze the phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Depletion of GSK-3β from mammalian cell lysates abrogates phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286. (A) Detergent lysates prepared from NIH-3T3 cells were precipitated with either NRS (lane 1) or antibody to GSK-3β (lanes 2,3). Immune complexes ... Control of cyclin D1 turnover via the Ras–PI3K–Akt pathway  The Ras–Raf1–MEK–ERK kinase cascade regulates cyclin D1 expression and its assembly with CDK4 (Albanese et al. 1995; Lavoie et al. 1996; Winston et al. 1996; Aktas et al. 1997; Kerkhoff and Rapp 1997; Weber et al. 1997; Cheng et al. 1998). However, Ras signaling activates several other pathways, including one that inhibits the activity of GSK-3β. Specifically, Ras and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) collaborate to activate the c-Akt proto-oncogene product (also designated protein kinase B; Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 1994, 1997; Boudewijn et al. 1995; Franke et al. 1995, 1997; Klinghoffer et al. 1996; Kauffmann-Zeh et al. 1997; Vanhaesebroeck et al. 1997). In turn, Akt down-regulates GSK-3β through site-specific phosphorylation (Cross et al. 1995; Dudek et al. 1997; Vanhaesebroeck et al. 1997), which should inhibit the rate of cyclin D1 turnover. Because Ras signaling depends on growth factor stimulation, the rate of cyclin D1 turnover in mouse fibroblasts should be influenced by serum stimulation. Therefore, we compared the half-life of cyclin D1 in cells rendered quiescent by serum starvation to that in cells proliferating in the presence of serum. Because synthesis of cyclin D1 also requires serum-derived growth factors, it was necessary to use NIH-3T3 cells engineered to overexpress cyclin D1. The half-life of ectopically expressed cyclin D1 in quiescent cells, as determined by pulse–chase analysis, was about 13 min, as compared with a half-life of 24 min in serum-stimulated cells (Table (Table1).1). Because of the rapidity of cyclin D1 turnover under both conditions, we had not noted this difference previously (Diehl et al. 1997), but in a series of independent experiments, the difference proved to be highly significant (see, Table Table1,1, legend). In agreement with results of others (Welsh et al. 1996), the catalytic activity of GSK-3β isolated from serum-stimulated cells was reduced approximately threefold relative to the activity of GSK-3β isolated from serum-starved cells (data not shown), consistent with negative regulation of GSK-3β by mitogens (see above).  Table 1 Table 1 Cyclin D1 half-life in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts Next, we determined the consequences of overexpressing a constitutively active isoform of Akt (MyrAkt), which contains an amino-terminal myristoylation signal that enables Akt membrane association (Franke et al. 1995). NIH-3T3 cells were infected with a retrovirus encoding MyrAkt or with a control virus encoding the T cell coreceptor CD8, and 48 hr later, cells were pulse-labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine and then chased in the presence of the unlabeled precursor for various times. In fibroblasts infected with the control CD8 vector, the observed half-life of metabolically labeled, immunoprecipitated cyclin D1 was about 20 minutes (Fig. (Fig.4A,4A, lanes 2–6; Matsushime et al. 1992). In contrast, the half-life of cyclin D1 in cells expressing MyrAkt was extended two to threefold (lanes 7–11). MyrAkt expression was documented by immunoprecipitation with antiserum to a carboxy-terminal Akt epitope (Fig. (Fig.4B,4B, lane 2). Because PI3K down-regulates GSK-3β through its activity on Akt, inhibition of PI3K should conversely accelerate cyclin D1 turnover. We therefore examined cyclin D1 stability in NIH-3T3 cells treated with wortmannin, a specific PI3K inhibitor (Ui et al. 1995). Treatment of intact cells with the inhibitor reproducibly accelerated cyclin D1 turnover more than twofold (10 min vs. 24 min, Table Table1)1) and also reduced the steady-state levels of D1, as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown).  Figure 4 Figure 4 Overexpression of MyrAkt stabilizes cyclin D1 in vivo. (A) NIH-3T3 cells infected with virus encoding the T-cell coreceptor (CD8; lanes 1–6) or MyrAkt (lanes 7–11) were labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then chased ... Although Ras activity should stimulate both cyclin D1 synthesis and assembly through the Raf1–MEK–ERK pathway, a clear prediction is that it should also stabilize cyclin D1 through PI3K–Akt–GSK-3β signaling. Corollaries are that Ras mutants specifically defective in PI3K signaling, or constitutively active Raf1 or MEK1 (acting downstream of Ras in a parallel pathway), should not be able to stabilize cyclin D1, even though they should still support cyclin D1 synthesis and assembly. To determine the ability of Ras itself to modulate cyclin D1 turnover, we transfected NIH-3T3 cells with an oncogenic Ha-Ras allele (RasV12), or with a double mutant (RasV12.S35) that cannot activate PI3K (Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 1994, 1997; White et al. 1995; Kauffman-Zeh et al. 1997). Serum-deprived cell lines expressing these mutants synthesized cyclin D1 in direct contrast to parental NIH-3T3 cells, which require serum stimulation for cyclin D1 induction (Matsushime et al. 1992, 1994). Therefore, pulse–chase analyses were carried out in serum-starved transformants that manifest minimal endogenous Ras activity. The half-life of cyclin D1 in serum-starved RasV12 transformants was about 30 min, but was reduced to 14 min in cells expressing RasV12.S35 (Table (Table1),1), implying that PI3K signaling was required for the ability of Ras to stabilize cyclin D1.  Like Ras mutants defective in the PI3K pathway, constitutively active MEK1 was unable to extend the half-life of cyclin D1, despite its ability to promote cyclin D1 synthesis and assembly in serum-deprived cells (Cheng et al. 1998). For these experiments, we used NIH-3T3 cells harboring an active MEK1 mutant (previously designated MEK1*) expressed under the control of an inducible sheep metallothionein promoter. When these cells were treated for 6 hr with zinc in medium lacking serum, the half-life of induced cyclin D1 was only 11 min, versus 24 min for serum-treated control cells (Table (Table1).1). These results confirm that signaling through the Ras–Raf1–MEK1–ERK pathway is itself insufficient to extend the turnover of cyclin D1, although it facilitates cyclin D1 induction and assembly with CDK4 (Cheng et al. 1998).  GSK-3β redirects cyclin D1 to the cytoplasm  Cyclin D1 is a nuclear protein during the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but it exits the nucleus during S phase (Baldin et al. 1993). Because GSK-3β positively regulates NFAT nuclear export via site-specific phosphorylation (Beals et al. 1997), we considered the possibility that it might also affect the subcellular distribution of cyclin D1. NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged cyclin D1 (Flag–D1) and CDK4 together with different forms of GSK-3β. Both the wild-type and kinase-defective forms of GSK-3β were engineered to express an amino-terminal Myc epitope to enable their detection by the 9E10 monoclonal antibody. Thirty-six hours post-transfection, the cells were fixed, and the cellular localization of Flag–D1 was visualized by immunofluorescent staining with the M2 antibody to the Flag tag. As shown previously (Diehl and Sherr 1997), most of the ectopically expressed Flag–D1 concentrated in the nucleus when it was coexpressed with CDK4 (Fig. (Fig.5A,5A, left panels). In contrast, coexpression of wild-type GSK-3β with Flag–D1 and CDK4 resulted in the redistribution of Flag–D1 to the cytoplasm (middle panels). Cyclin D1 was detected primarily in the cytoplasm in >50% of the cells coexpressing wild-type GSK-3β, whereas it largely remained nuclear in its absence (Fig. (Fig.5B).5B). Flag–D1 also localized to the nucleus when it was coexpressed with kinase-deficent GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.5A,5A, right panels, and B), consistent with the idea that cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 requires GSK-3β activity. In agreement, the D1-(T286A) mutant remained in the nucleus and was unaffected by GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.5B,5B, and see below). Although kinase-deficent GSK-3β has the potential to inhibit D1 phosphorylation in vitro by the wild-type enzyme (Fig. (Fig.2B),2B), it did not act as a dominant-negative mutant when coexpressed with wild-type GSK-3β in mammalian cells. This may not be surprising, as inhibition likely requires stoichiometric binding whereas catalysis does not. Expression of either the wild-type or the kinase-defective forms of GSK-3β was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining with the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). The dual requirement for GSK-3β activity and integrity of Thr-286 in cyclin D1 implies that its cytoplasmic localization is mediated by GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of D1 on this residue.  Figure 5 Figure 5 GSK-3β overexpression redirects cyclin D1 to the cytoplasm. (A) NIH-3T3 cells transiently expressing CDK4 and either Flag-tagged cyclin D1 (left), Flag-tagged cyclin D1 plus wild-type GSK-3β (wtGSK–3β; middle), or Flag-tagged ... On the basis of these results, we considered the possibility that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 might account for its relocalization from the nucleus during S phase. Therefore, we examined the subcellular distribution of wild-type cyclin D1 and the D1-(T286A) mutant throughout the cell cycle. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts engineered to stably overexpress either Flag-tagged cyclin D1 or cyclin D1-(T286A) were derived by coselection with puromycin and represented uncloned populations of transfectants expressing variable amounts of ectopic cyclin D1 per cell. The D1-(T286A) mutant does not act as a dominant-negative to inhibit cell cycle progression (Diehl and Sherr 1997), and like NIH-3T3 cells enforced to stably express wild-type D1 (Quelle et al. 1993), transfected cells appear to have a modestly contracted G1 interval and enter S phase about 2 hr earlier than their parental counterparts. Cell lines engineered to express D1 were rendered quiescent by contact inhibition and serum starvation for 30 hr and were then restimulated to synchronously enter the cell cycle by trypsinization and replating on glass coverslips in complete medium containing serum. At various times thereafter, fixed cells were examined by immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody to cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 accumulated in the nucleus of cells as they entered S phase (Fig. (Fig.6A;6A; cf. 6 and 10 hr), but as S phase progressed (12 hr), increased cytoplasmic D1 staining was observed (Baldin et al. 1993). By G2 phase (18 hr), cyclin D1 was located almost entirely in the cytoplasm. In contrast, cyclin D1-(T286A) was retained in the nucleus throughout interphase (Fig. (Fig.6B).6B). Thus, cell cycle-dependent redistribution of cyclin D1 depends on the integrity of Thr-286, presumably reflecting its phosphorylation status in response to GSK-3β.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Cell cycle-dependent redistribution of cyclin D1 depends on the integrity of Thr-286. NIH-3T3 cells engineered to overexpress wild-type, Flag-tagged cyclin D1 (A) or Flag-tagged cyclin D1-(T286A) (B) were arrested in G0 by serum deprivation and contact ... Cell cycle-dependent localization of GSK-3β  GSK-3β is thought to be a cytoplasmic kinase (Boyle et al. 1991a) whose activity is down-regulated by growth factor stimulation. However, it has been reported to mediate NFAT nuclear export through direct phosphorylation (Beals et al. 1997), implying that at least a fraction of GSK-3β must be nuclear. To address this issue, NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing cyclin D1 were rendered quiescent by contact inhibition and serum starvation for 26 hr and then allowed to synchronously re-enter the cell cycle by replating on glass coverslips at low density in medium containing serum. Immunofluorescent staining revealed that GSK-3β was exclusively cytoplasmic during G1 phase with predominant perinuclear staining (Fig. (Fig.7A,7A, 6 and 8 hr). However, during S phase, GSK-3β staining was detected in the nuclei as well (16 and 18 hr). In parallel, G1-phase (6 hr) and S-phase cells (16 hr) were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, which were blotted for GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.7B).7B). During G1, <5% of GSK-3β was detected in the nuclear fraction (cf. lanes 1 and 2), but during S phase, ∼25% of GSK-3β was detected in the nuclear fraction (cf. lanes 3 and 4). Thus, during S phase, a fraction of GSK-3β localizes to the nucleus, while cyclin D1 is redirected into the cytoplasm. Together, these data suggest that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286 by GSK-3β may occur in the nucleus to accelerate D1 export and cytoplasmic proteolysis.  Figure 7 Figure 7 Subcellular localization of GSK-3β throughout the cell cycle. (A) NIH-3T3 cells engineered to overexpress Flag-tagged wild-type cyclin D1 were arrested by serum deprivation and contact inhibition and then dispersed and restimulated with serum ... Go to: Discussion GSK-3β is a cyclin D1 protein kinase  The turnover of cyclin D1 in proliferating cells is rapid (tequation M1, ∼20 min), whereas that of its catalytic partner CDK4 is relatively slow (tequation M2, ∼4 hr) (Matsushime et al. 1992). This creates a dynamic equilibrium in which regulatory cyclin D1 subunits exchange in and out of holoenzyme complexes with CDK4 as mitogen-stimulated cells move through G1 phase (Sherr 1993). Maintenance of active D1–CDK4 complexes requires persistent mitogenic signaling (Matsushime et al. 1991) through a Ras-dependent kinase cascade that utilizes Raf and MEK intermediates to target the ERKs (Albanese et al. 1995; Lavoie et al. 1996; Winston et al. 1996; Aktas et al. 1997; Kerkhoff and Rapp 1997; Weber et al. 1997; Cheng et al. 1998). In turn, mitogen withdrawal cancels Ras signaling and cyclin D1 synthesis, and the fast turnover of D1 ensures that D1–CDK4 complexes rapidly dissipate as cell proliferation ceases, usually within a single cycle.  Cyclin D1 proteolysis is a regulated event that proceeds via the ubiquitin-dependent 26S proteasome. Degradation is facilitated by phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue located near the D1 carboxyl terminus, and elimination of this site through simple point mutation (e.g., T286A) markedly stabilizes the cyclin (tequation M3, 2–3 hr; Diehl et al. 1997). Although the identity of the D1 Thr-286 kinase has remained unknown, several lines of evidence now indicate that GSK-3β can carry out this function. First, purified GSK-3β or GSK-3β recovered from mouse fibroblasts was able to phosphorylate recombinant cyclin D1 only at this site in vitro. Second, immunodepletion of GSK-3β from mammalian cell extracts prevented phosphorylation of recombinant cyclin D1 on Thr-286. Therefore, not only can GSK-3β catalyze this phosphorylation event, but it appears to be a major kinase regulating this function, at least in lysates of NIH-3T3 cells. Third, a Ras-initiated kinase signaling cascade that negatively regulates GSK-3β activity in vivo was found to stabilize cyclin D1 in living cells. Manipulation of any of the components of this signaling pathway (Ras, PI3K, or Akt) affected cyclin D1 turnover in the predicted manner. Finally, phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 appears to facilitate its redistribution from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, and overexpression of catalytically active, but not kinase-defective, GSK-3β increased its cytoplasmic localization.  Although GSK-3β could phosphorylate Thr-286 in recombinant cyclin D1 or in a GST–D1 fusion protein containing only the carboxy-terminal 41 amino acids of the cyclin, it appeared to phosphorylate cyclin D1 in complexes with CDK4 more efficiently. This result is in general agreement with previous observations that phosphorylation of the D1 subunit increases as cyclin D1–CDK complexes achieve maximal levels and mammalian cells cross the G1/S boundary (Matsushime et al. 1991). Nonetheless, the rapid turnover of ectopically expressed, unassembled forms of cyclin D1 in fibroblasts rendered quiescent by serum starvation still requires their phosphorylation on Thr-286 (Diehl et al. 1997). Thus, the kinase that phosphorylates unbound cyclin D1 subunits must be active in quiescent cells. GSK-3β activity increases two- to threefold in cells deprived of growth factors (Cross et al. 1995; He et al. 1995; our data not shown). Under such conditions, we observed that ectopically expressed D1 subunits were degraded more rapidly than those expressed in proliferating cells or in serum-starved cells transformed by oncogenic Ras (see below). Thus, although unassembled cyclin D1 appears to be a poorer GSK-3β substrate relative to CDK4-bound subunits, the increased activity of GSK-3β in growth factor-deprived cells may compensate.  Phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286 is dependent on the integrity of Pro-287 (data not shown) suggesting that a proline-directed kinase targets this site. Although cyclin D1 also contains a threonine at residue 288, Thr-286 is the only site of D1 threonine phosphorylation in mammalian cells (Diehl et al. 1997). GSK-3β can act as a proline-directed kinase, and the ability of the purified enzyme to phosphorylate a bacterially expressed, affinity-purified GST fusion protein containing only the carboxy-terminal 41 amino acids of D1 supports the principle. Several other proline-directed kinases, including ERK2, SAPK, cyclin E–CDK2, and cyclin D1–CDK4 itself were unable to phosphorylate cyclin D1 on Thr-286. GSK-3β can also act in a processive manner, requiring that its substrate first be phosphorylated by another kinase for maximal activity. The serines closest to Thr-286 lie some distance away at residues 257 and 258. Our data do not formally exclude processive phosphorylation, as a fraction of the cyclin D1 molecules expressed in proliferating mammalian cells (and in insect Sf9 cells) is phosphorylated on as-yet-unmapped serine residues.  An unexpected result was that recombinant GSK-3β and cyclin D1, whether free or bound to CDK4, were able to interact physically with one another in insect Sf9 cells. Only a small fraction of catalytically active GSK-3β associated with cyclin D1, but binding was significantly potentiated when GSK-3β was rendered catalytically inert. This suggested that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by bound wild-type GSK-3β might destabilize such complexes, and in agreement, depletion of ATP from Sf9 extracts facilitated net complex formation two- to threefold (data not shown). Expression of the kinase-defective form of GSK-3β together with cyclin D1 in Sf9 cells blocked Thr-286 phosphorylation of D1 by endogenous kinase(s) and significantly inhibited the ability of ectopically expressed wild-type GSK-3β to phosphorylate the cyclin. Preferential binding of the inactive form of GSK-3β to cyclin D1 most likely accounts for its ability to suppress D1 phosphorylation by the wild-type kinase.  Cyclin D1 turnover is regulated via the mitogen-dependent Ras–PI3K–Akt pathway  Stimulation of cells with growth factors such as insulin or epidermal growth factor inhibits GSK-3β activity in a PI3K- and Akt-dependent manner (Saito et al. 1994; Boudewijn et al. 1995; Cross et al. 1995). If GSK-3β is a bona fide cyclin D1 kinase, then increased signaling through the PI3K–Akt pathway should stabilize cyclin D1 and vice versa. Enforced overexpression of a constitutively active form of Akt resulted in a threefold prolongation of cyclin D1 half-life (tequation M4, ∼60 min) as well as a twofold decrease in D1 phosphorylation (data not shown). Conversely, inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin shortened the half-life of cyclin D1 from ∼20 to 10 min. Therefore, mitogenic signaling through the Ras–PI3K–Akt pathway can increase cyclin D1 stability by extinguishing GSK-3β activity, but if GSK-3β activity is not attenuated, cyclin D1 is actually turned over more rapidly than thought previously.  Transformation of NIH-3T3 cells with an oncogenic Harvey-Ras gene (RasV12) stabilized ectopically expressed cyclin D1 in cells deprived of serum (tequation M5, ∼30 min vs. 13 min for untransformed cells). However, enforced expression of a double mutant (RasV12.S35) that is selectively defective in its ability to activate PI3K (Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 1994, 1997; White et al. 1995) had no such effect (tequation M6, 14 min). Ras independently regulates the Raf1–MEK–ERK kinase cascade. Although an inducible, constitutively active MEK1 mutant is able to trigger cyclin D1 synthesis and assembly with CDK4 in the complete absence of serum stimulation (Cheng et al. 1998), it was unable to extend the half-life of cyclin D1 (tequation M7, 11 min). Therefore, cyclin D1 synthesis, assembly, and turnover are all regulated through Ras-dependent signaling, and while the Raf1–MEK1–ERK pathway guarantees cyclin D1 synthesis and assembly, the PI3K–Akt–GSK-3β pathway selectively affects cyclin D1 stability. Importantly, the identification of the latter pathway points to a previously unexpected mode of regulation of cyclin D1 by mitogenic signaling, further underscoring its role as a growth factor sensor.  Unlike oncogenic Ras alleles such as RasV12, the double mutant, RasV12.S35, which does not activate PI3K, is attenuated in its ability to transform established fibroblast cell lines. However, its transforming potency can be rescued by other nontransforming Ras alleles, such as RasV12.C40, that do activate PI3K (White et al. 1995; Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 1997; Kauffmann-Zeh et al. 1997). Given that Ras transformation depends on cyclin D1 accumulation (Peeper et al. 1997; Mittnacht et al. 1997), stabilization of D1 may be necessary for the protein levels to rise to a threshold that enables G1 progression.  GSK-3β activity links cyclin D1 stability and subcellular localization  The critical functions of cyclin D1 during G1 phase, including phosphorylation of Rb and titration of p27Kip1, are nuclear events, and cyclin D1 is superfluous for completion of the cycle once cells enter S phase (Matsushime et al. 1991). Although cyclin D1 progressively accumulates in the nucleus during G1 phase, it redistributes into the cytoplasm as cells move through S phase, implying a periodicity of D1 function in proliferating cells that is independent of its rate of synthesis (Baldin et al. 1993). The stable D1-(T286A) mutant, unlike wild-type D1, remained in the nucleus throughout interphase, suggesting that redirection of cyclin D1 to the cytoplasm is mediated by Thr-286 phosphorylation. Conversely, overexpression of GSK-3β enforced cytoplasmic compartmentalization of D1 and was dependent on the kinase’s catalytic activity. Therefore, cyclin D1 proteolysis and relocalization are functionally linked through the status of Thr-286.  There are no amino acid sequences in cyclin D1 that show obvious homology to canonical nuclear import or export signals (NES), so other proteins likely play key roles in determining D1 compartmentalization (LaBaer et al. 1997; Diehl and Sherr 1997). One idea is that GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of nuclear cyclin D1 triggers its export to the cytoplasm, for example by facilitating an interaction between cyclin D1 and an exportin. Reminiscent of these findings, GSK-3β also phosphorylates the T cell transcription factor NFAT, causing its cytoplasmic redistribution (Beals et al. 1997). Alternatively, GSK-3β might phosphorylate cyclin D1 in the cytoplasm, preventing its association with proteins required for nuclear import and thereby targeting its cytoplasmic degradation. GSK-3β itself accumulates primarily in the cytoplasm of asynchronously proliferating cells (Boyle et al. 1991a). However, we observed that a subpopulation of GSK-3β becomes nuclear during S phase, the interval of the cycle in which cyclin D1 leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Treatment of NIH-3T3 cells with leptomycin B (Nishi et al. 1994), an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (Fornerod et al. 1997), resulted in accumulation of the majority of GSK-3β in the nucleus (data not shown). Together, these results suggest that GSK-3β actively shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and that its compartmentalization is cell cycle dependent. Therefore, nuclear accumulation of GSK-3β may be necessary for the relocalization of cyclin D1 observed during S phase.  Whether or not GSK-3β phosphorylates cyclin D1 in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or both, the data imply that cyclin D1 degradation occurs preferentially in the cytoplasm. Proteasomes exist in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Reits et al. 1997), but there are emerging precedents for compartment-specific degradation. For example, the p53 tumor suppressor is a nuclear transcription factor whose stability is regulated through ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. p53 degradation depends on Mdm2 (Haupt et al. 1997; Kubbutat et al. 1997), which shuttles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and appears to direct p53 to cytoplasmic proteasomes (Roth et al. 1998). Interfering with nuclear export of p53, either through mutation of the Mdm2 NES or through other manipulations that affect transport per se, stabilizes p53. By analogy, identification of proteins that interact specifically with the Thr-286 phosphorylated form of cyclin D1 will be necessary to enhance our understanding of its compartmentalization during the cell cycle.  A role for GSK-3β in cancer?  Overexpression of cyclin D1 is a common event in various forms of cancer. D1 can be overexpressed as a result of gene amplification or because it is targeted through chromosomal translocations (Hall and Peters 1996). However, in certain tumors, high levels of cyclin D1 expression have not been explained by such mechanisms, and events affecting cyclin D1 turnover might play some role. Although the p16INK4a–cyclin D1–Rb pathway is disabled in many forms of human cancer, colon carcinomas provide a conspicuous exception. Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor is the single most common event in colon cancer (Powell et al. 1992). APC is a target of Wnt signaling (for review, see Kinzler and Vogelstein 1996), and it regulates the proteolytic turnover of β-catenin in a manner that depends on phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK-3β (Rubinfield et al. 1993; Yost et al. 1996). β-Catenin mutants that have lost GSK-3β phosphorylation sites remain constitutively active as coactivators of TCF/LEF-dependent transcription, and such mutations have now been found in the major fraction of colon cancers that lack mutated APC alleles (Korinek et al. 1997; Morin et al. 1997). The fact that GSK-3β can also regulate cyclin D1 turnover suggests that deregulation of Wnt signaling in colon cancer may target cyclin D1 in addition to the APC–β-catenin complex.  Although cyclin D1 is overexpressed in a significant number of human cancers, overexpression alone is insufficient to promote tumorigenesis. In vitro studies have revealed that inhibition of cyclin D1 nuclear export unmasks its neoplastic potential. Cyclin D1 nuclear export depends upon phosphorylation of a C-terminal residue, threonine 286, (Thr-286) which in turn promotes association with the nuclear exportin, CRM1. Mutation of Thr-286 to a non-phosphorylatable residue results in a constitutively nuclear cyclin D1 protein with significantly increased oncogenic potential. To determine whether cyclin D1 is subject to mutations that inhibit its nuclear export in human cancer, we have sequenced exon 5 of cyclin D1 in primary esophageal carcinoma samples and in cell lines derived from esophageal cancer. Our work reveals that cyclin D1 is subject to mutations in primary human cancer. The mutations identified specifically disrupt phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286, thereby enforcing nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1. Through characterization of these mutants, we also define an acidic residue within the C-terminus of cyclin D1 that is necessary for recognition and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta. Finally, through construction of compound mutants, we demonstrate that cell transformation by the cancer-derived cyclin D1 alleles correlates with their ability to associate with and activate CDK4. Our data reveal that cyclin D1 is subject to mutations in primary human cancer that specifically disrupt phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of cyclin D1 and suggest that such mutations contribute to the genesis and progression of neoplastic growth.  Keywords: cyclin D1, GSK-3beta, CDK4, nuclear export, cancer Top of page Introduction The cell cycle is a tightly regulated cellular clock composed of four distinct phases: two gap phases, G1 and G2, separating the DNA synthetic (S) phase from mitosis (M). Progression through each phase of the cell cycle is driven by complexes minimally composed of a regulatory, cyclin, and a catalytic, CDK, subunit. Progression through G1 phase is initiated by mitogenic stimulation, which in turn initiates the expression and assembly of the D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) with their cognate catalytic partners, CDK4/6.  The cyclin D/CDK4 holoenzyme has two functions necessary for cell cycle progression. The first is the initiation of phosphorylation-dependent inactivation of the retinoblastoma family of proteins, Rb, p107 and p130 (Hatakeyama et al., 1994; Harbour et al., 1999; Calbo et al., 2002; Farkas et al., 2002; Leng et al., 2002), which is subsequently completed by the cyclin E/CDK2 complex (Harbour et al., 1999). The second involves the stoichiometric association of cyclin D/CDK4 with Cip/Kip family proteins. This association facilitates both cyclin D1/CDK4 activity through increased nuclear retention and subunit assembly, while simultaneously preventing Cip/Kip access to cyclin E/CDK2 complexes (Cheng et al., 1998, 1999; Sherr and Roberts, 1999; Muraoka et al., 2001, 2002; Alt et al., 2002).  The D-type cyclins are unique in responding directly to mitogenic signaling pathways rather than signaling intrinsic to cell cycle progression. Expression of cyclin D1 requires Ras-dependent activation of the Raf–Mek–Erk kinase module (Albanese et al., 1995; Lavoie et al., 1996; Winston et al., 1996; Aktas et al., 1997; Kerkhoff and Rapp, 1997; Cheng et al., 1998). In addition, maximal accumulation of cyclin D1 depends on phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase-dependent activation of Akt and the concomitant inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) (Rodriguez-Viciana et al., 1994; Kauffmann-Zeh et al., 1997). Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta-dependent phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on threonine 286 (Thr-286) triggers the nuclear export and cytoplasmic proteolysis of cyclin D1 via the 26S proteasome (Diehl et al., 1998).  Perturbation of the cell cycle machinery is one of the hallmarks of cancer (Collecchi et al., 2000). Cyclin D1, the Bcl1 oncogene, is involved in the t(11;14)(q13;32) chromosomal translocation associated with mantle cell lymphomas (Lukas et al., 1994; Lovec et al., 1994a, 1994b) and is amplified in a subset of breast, bladder, esophageal, lung and squamous cell carcinomas (Hall and Peters, 1996; Diehl, 2002). Yet, despite its overexpression in a number of malignancies, overexpression of wild-type cyclin D1 is not by itself sufficient to induce a transformed cellular phenotype in cell-based systems (Quelle et al., 1993; Alt et al., 2000). In contrast, as we have previously shown, expression of an artificially engineered cyclin D1-T286A or a naturally occurring alternative splice variant of cyclin D1 lacking the fifth exon, cyclin D1b – neither D1-T286A nor cyclin D1b is phosphorylated by GSK-3beta and thus, is refractory to phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export – has the capacity to drive transformation of murine fibroblasts in the absence of a collaborating oncogene (Alt et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2003). Cumulatively, our results support a model wherein dysregulation of cyclin D1 nuclear export increases its oncogenic potential, emphasizing the biological relevance of identifying cyclin D1 mutations in human cancer that target residues essential for these regulatory functions.  Little evidence exists for the identification of cyclin D1 mutations in human cancer that specifically target its phosphorylation at Thr-286 and/or nuclear export. Herein, we report the identification of such cyclin D1 mutations in esophageal cancer. The mutations specifically disrupt cyclin D1 phosphorylation on Thr-286, resulting in inhibition of S-phase specific nuclear export. In addition, through structure–function analysis of cancer-derived deletion mutants, we have identified structural requirements in cyclin D1 necessary for its recognition by GSK-3beta that serve to coordinate GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286 (Benzeno and Diehl, 2004). Indeed, our data demonstrate the occurrence of deregulated cyclin D1 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling in human cancer.  Top of page Results Identification of cyclin D1 mutations in human cancer Overexpression of nuclear export-defective cyclin D1 mutants in murine fibroblasts or in transgenic mice confers a neoplastic phenotype on expressing cells demonstrating the distinctive oncogenic potential of such cyclin D1 mutants (Alt et al., 2000; Lu et al., 2003; Gladden et al., 2005). These data suggest that cyclin D1 may be subject to mutations in human cancer that specifically disrupt its nuclear export. To address this issue, we screened a panel of 90 primary human esophageal tumor-derived patient DNA samples for cyclin D1 mutations. We chose esophageal cancer owing to the high prevalence of cyclin D1 overexpression (40–60%) and its nuclear localization in esophageal adeno- and squamous cell carcinomas, a striking percentage of which are not associated with gene amplification (Adelaide et al., 1995; Arber et al., 1996; Bani-Hani et al., 2000; Lin and Beerm, 2004). Sequencing exon 5 of the cyclin D1 gene in this set of tumor samples revealed a threonine to arginine substitution at codon 286 (T286R) and a deletion encompassing codons 266–295 of cyclin D1 (Delta266–295). The deletion is reminiscent of cyclin D1b, which is expressed as a consequence of cancer-specific alternative splicing (Lu et al., 2003; Solomon et al., 2003). Importantly, no such mutations were identified in either matched normal or in 100 unmatched normal esophageal tissue samples. Together, our results provide strong evidence that these cyclin D1 alterations are not a result of inherent polymorphisms in the cyclin D1 gene. Supporting evidence stems from the identification of a second mutation at Thr-286 (T/H) through a search of the available expressed sequence tag (EST) database. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain the cell line from which this cyclin D1 allele was sequenced in order to confirm the presence of this mutation. To characterize the properties of the cancer-derived mutants, we engineered NIH-3T3 cell lines that express either D1-T286R isolated from esophageal cancer or cyclin D1-Delta289–292, a deletion mutant recently identified in endometrial cancer (Moreno-Bueno et al., 2003). Neither D1-T286R nor D1-Delta289–292 was phosphorylated at Thr-286 in vivo (data not shown). Consistent with inhibition of Thr-286 phosphorylation, both D1-T286R and D1-Delta289–292 exhibited a significantly increased half-life relative to wild-type cyclin D1 (Figure 1a). In addition, the patient-derived cyclin D1 mutants featured constitutive nuclear localization as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence (Figure 1b and c) and retained their ability to support CDK4 catalytic activity as assessed by in vitro Rb kinase assays (Figure 1d).

(a) Cyclin D1 cancer-derived mutants are stabilized. NIH-3T3 cells stably overexpressing the indicated cyclin D1 mutants were treated with cycloheximide for the indicated intervals. Lysates prepared from the respective cell lines were processed for Western analysis using the cyclin D1 antibody. (b) NIH-3T3 cells stably overexpressing wild-type cyclin D1, D1-T286R and D1-Delta289–292 were fixed and the localization of either cyclin D1 protein was determined by immunofluorescence.

(d) D1, D1-T286R, and D1-Delta289–292 were precipitated from NIH-3T3 cells stably overexpressing the respective Flag-tagged protein and subjected to in vitro kinase assays using recombinant glutathione-S-transferase-Rb.

IP with normal rabbit immunoglobulin G was used as a control.  Full figure and legend (134K)  To expand our analysis, we screened a panel of 20 independently derived human esophageal carcinoma cell lines for mutations in exon 5 of cyclin D1. Three of these, TE3, TE7 and TE12, harbored a mutation in cyclin D1 resulting in a proline to alanine substitution at codon 287. The proline-287 (P287)A mutation was confirmed in TE3 and TE7 cell lines obtained from an independent source. The expression of the alternatively spliced cyclin D1b was not detected in either TE3 or TE7, but could be detected in TE12 (Lu et al., 2003). The capacity of GSK-3beta to function as a proline-directed kinase (Doble and Woodgett, 2003) implies that P287 is likely to be required for Thr-286 phosphorylation (Diehl et al., 1997). To test this notion, NIH-3T3 cell lines were engineered to express the cyclin D1-P287A mutant. Immunoblot with a phosphospecific antibody revealed the absence of Thr-286 phosphorylation in the D1-P287A mutant (Figure 2a). Consistent with inhibition of Thr-286 phosphorylation, D1-P287A accumulated predominantly in the nucleus of expressing cells (Figure 2b and c). We also examined the subcellular localization of D1-P287A in TE3 (squamous cell carcinoma) and TE7 (adenocarcinoma), which harbor the endogenous cyclin D1-P287A mutant. D1-P287A was almost entirely nuclear in both TE3 and TE7, whereas wild-type cyclin D1, which is expressed in KYSE520 cells, exhibited both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining (Figure 3a and b). As the P287A mutation only occurs in one cyclin D1 allele in TE3/T37 cell lines, the absence of cytoplasmic staining suggests that accumulation of cyclin D1-P287A greatly exceeds that of cyclin D1 in these cells.

(d) Following co-infection of D1, D1-T286A and D1-P287A with CDK4 in Sf9 cells, cyclin D1 protein was immunoprecipitated using either the M2 antibody or cyclin D1 antibody and assayed for its ability to support Rb kinase activity, visualized by autoradiography following transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. The same membrane was processed for Western blot analysis of phospho-serine 780 Rb, cyclin D1 and co-precipitating CDK4.  Full figure and legend (193K)  Phosphorylation of Thr-286 not only directs cyclin D1 nuclear export but also promotes rapid proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin D1 (Diehl et al., 1997). We therefore predicted that cyclin D1-P287A would exhibit an extended half-life relative to wild-type cyclin D1. We examined turnover of cyclin D1 versus D1-P287A in both the esophageal carcinoma-derived cell lines and NIH-3T3 cell engineered to express D1-P287A ectopically. Consistent with loss of Thr-286 phosphorylation and increased nuclear retention, cyclin D1-P287A exhibited decreased kinetics of turnover in both NIH-3T3 cells and the esophageal cancer cell lines, TE3 and TE7, harboring the constitutively nuclear D1-P287A mutant (Figure 3c). However, endogenous wild-type cyclin D1, in NIH-3T3 and KYSE520 cells, exhibited the expected short half-life of approximately 30 min (Figure 3c). Importantly, cyclin D1-P287A retained the ability to support CDK4 activation as demonstrated by phosphorylation of recombinant Rb using in vitro kinase assays (Figure 3d).  C-terminal acidic residues within cyclin D1 coordinate glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta-dependent phosphorylation Although our data demonstrate that the deletion of amino acids 289–292 disrupts Thr-286 phosphorylation, the underlying mechanism is not inherently obvious. Through careful examination of the C-terminus of all three D-type cyclins, we noted the presence of aspartic acid residues positioned at (n+3) and (n+6) relative to Thr-286 (n) that are spatially conserved in other D-type cyclins (Figure 4a). Importantly, the deletion of amino acids 289–292 of cyclin D1 in endometrial cancer encompasses both aspartic acids D289 and D292. The crystal structure of GSK-3beta revealed a unique priming mechanism that regulates GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of its substrates (Bax et al., 2001; Dajani et al., 2001; Frame et al., 2001). Priming phosphorylation occurs at position (n+4) relative to the bona fide residue of GSK-3beta phosphorylation (n). Because cyclin D1 is not a recipient of a priming phosphorylation, we considered the possibility that a proximal negatively charged acidic residue (aspartic acid) within cyclin D1 might facilitate substrate binding within the dense positively charged substrate-binding groove of GSK-3beta. We generated cell lines expressing either double D1-D289/D292A, or the single D1-D289A and D1-D292A, alanine substitution mutants to assess their role in the regulation of Thr-286 phosphorylation. In contrast to D1-D292A, neither D1-D289/D292A nor D1-D289A was detectably phosphorylated on Thr-286 (Figure 4b, lanes 3–5), demonstrating that D289 positioned (n+3) from Thr-286 contributes to GSK-3beta-dependent phosphorylation of cyclin D1. In addition, to ensure these results were not owing to epitope masking, we tested the ability of GSK-3beta to phosphorylate wild-type cyclin D1 and D1-D289A in vitro. Cyclin D1/CDK4 and D1-D289A/CDK4 complexes purified from Sf9 lysates were used as substrates. Because a majority of wild-type cyclin D1 molecules are phosphorylated at Thr-286 in Sf9 cells, we first subjected purified cyclin D1 and D1-D289A to phosphatase treatment. Following extensive washing to remove phosphatase, equivalent concentrations of the respective cyclin substrates were incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant GSK-3beta. Wild-type cyclin D1 was efficiently phosphorylated by GSK-3beta, whereas phosphorylation of D1-D289A was significantly attenuated (Figure 4c and d). Similar results were obtained using the phospho-286 antibody to assess phosphorylation (data not shown). Importantly, all mutants retained the ability to associate with GSK-3beta (Figure 4e). Thus, abrogated cyclin D1 phosphorylation at Thr-286 is not the result of a disrupted cyclin D1–GSK-3beta complex. Our results identify residue D289, positioned (n+3) relative to Thr-286, as critical for efficient GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1. Figure 4.

Full figure and legend (139K)  These data demonstrate that Asp-289 is required for Thr-286 phosphorylation and suggest that the negative character of the aspartic acid residue might mimic that associated with a phosphate group and direct GSK-3beta phosphorylation of cyclin D1. To test whether cyclin D1 is recognized by GSK-3beta as a primed substrate, we assessed the ability of the GID polypeptide (Gsk-3beta interacting domain of axin) to inhibit GSK-3beta phosphorylation. GSK-3beta-interacting domain of axin preferentially inhibits GSK-3beta activity toward unprimed substrates (Yost et al., 1998; Hedgepeth et al., 1999; Fraser et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003). For these experiments, the C-terminal 41 residues of either cyclin D1 or D1-T286A were fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST), expressed in bacteria and used as substrates (Diehl et al., 1998), whereas protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor 2 (I-2) protein was used as an unprimed substrate control (Park et al., 1994; Zhang et al., 2003). As expected, GSK-3beta phosphorylation of I-2 was inhibited by GID in a concentration-dependent manner Figure 4f (lanes 7–9) and g. In contrast, GID did not alter GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1 Figure 4f (lanes 2–4) and g, demonstrating that phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by GSK-3beta differs from that of a true unprimed substrate.  The absence of Thr-286 phosphorylation in the D1-D289/292A and D1-D289A mutants suggested that both might accumulate in the nuclear compartment and be refractory to proteasomal degradation. Indeed, both mutants exhibited exclusively nuclear localization patterns (Figure 5a and b) as determined by immunofluorescent staining. Consistent with the absence of Thr-286 phosphorylation and their nuclear accumulation, both D1-D289A and D1-D289/292A exhibit a half-life in excess of 3 h, which is comparable to cyclin D1-T286A (Figure 5c). Although phosphorylation at Thr-286 was absent in both D1-D289A and D1-D289/292A mutants, both retained the ability to bind to Cip/Kip proteins and to support Rb kinase activity (Figure 5d), emphasizing the retained structural and functional integrity of these mutants. These data support a model wherein D289 functions to coordinate GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1.  Figure 5.

Full figure and legend (113K)  Cancer-derived cyclin D1 mutants exhibit oncogenic properties relative to wild-type cyclin D1 Cells engineered to overexpress cyclin D1 display a contracted G1 interval (Quelle et al., 1993) but do not exhibit a transformed phenotype. In contrast, a cyclin D1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated at Thr-286 (D1-T286A) and is constitutively nuclear promotes cellular transformation (Alt et al., 2000; Gladden et al., 2005), demonstrating that disruption of cyclin D1 nuclear export is an oncogenic event. Thus, we hypothesized that cancer-derived cyclin D1 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at Thr-286 and are thus constitutively nuclear should exhibit an increased transforming potential relative to wild-type cyclin D1. We tested this hypothesis using NIH-3T3 or NIH-3T3 derivatives that overexpress Flag-tagged mutant cyclin D1 isoforms and analysed these cells for characteristics of transformation. As published previously (Alt et al., 2000), early passage cell lines displayed normal growth control (data not shown). In contrast, over the course of five independent experiments utilizing cell lines of passage p10 or later, cyclin D1 mutants, D1-T286R and D1-Delta289–292, reproducibly formed foci (Figure 6a). Consistent with these results, identical results were obtained in experiments analysing anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, a more stringent criterion for oncogenic potential (Figure 6b and c). These data demonstrate that tumor-derived cyclin D1 mutations targeting Thr-286 phosphorylation and nuclear export confer an oncogenic advantage to cells expressing mutant forms of cyclin D1 that exhibit an increased capacity to drive neoplastic growth in the absence of a collaborating oncogene.

Full figure and legend (172K)  Transformation by constitutively nuclear cyclin D1 correlates with CDK4 activation Cyclin D1 was initially characterized as the allosteric regulatory subunit for CDK4/6 kinases. However, accumulating evidence suggests that cyclin D1 can also function as a transcriptional regulator independent of its capacity to regulate CDK activity (Fu et al., 2004). These observations prompted us to determine whether transformation by cyclin D1 is kinase dependent. To do so, we generated a cyclin D1-K114E (and compound T286A/R point mutants) that was previously characterized in vitro as 'kinase-dead' (Hinds et al., 1994; Coqueret, 2002). This single amino-acid change, Lys114 right arrow Glu (K114E), is thought to disrupt cyclin D1-CDK4 binding. We generated NIH-3T3 cells that stably express cyclin D1-T286R-KE, D1-KE and T286A-KE. All three KE mutants exhibited localization and degradation kinetics identical to their counterparts: D1, D1-T286A, D1-T286R (Figure 7a and b). To confirm whether the K114E mutation disrupts cyclin–CDK interactions, lysates prepared from NIH-3T3 cell lines overexpressing the respective K114E cyclin D1 mutant were precipitated with the M2 monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblot for CDK4. Surprisingly, endogenous CDK4 efficiently co-precipitated with all K114E derivative proteins, demonstrating that cyclin D1-CDK4 binding is not abolished in vivo (Figure 7c). Although mutant cyclins appear to associate effectively with CDK4 in cultured cells, immune complex kinase assays using the respective cyclin–CDK complexes revealed that all K114E mutant holoenzymes exhibited reduced kinase activity relative to wild-type counterparts, as assessed by total italic gamma32-P incorporation and immunoblotting for Rb phosphorylation at serine 780 (Ser780) (Kitagawa et al., 1996) (Figure 7c). Densitometric scanning revealed KE mutants retain approximately 20% of wild-type cyclin D1 activity towards Rb. Figure 7.

Phosphorylated Rb was visualized by autoradiography, following SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. The same membrane was probed with antibodies specific for phospho-serine 780 Rb. (d) NIH-3T3 (yellow), D1-3T3 (blue), D1-T286A (green) and TA-KE-3T3 (maroon) cell lines synchronized by culturing in media containing 0.1% serum for 24 h were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the addition of serum-derived growth factors and 5-bromo-2-'deoxyuridine. S-phase entry was monitored by flow cytometry.  Full figure and legend (197K)  Although the K114E mutants retain 20% of wild-type kinase activity, we reasoned that if kinase activation were critical for transformation of mouse fibroblasts, K114E mutant activity would be compromised. We assessed the ability of K114E mutant cyclin D1 derivatives to induce growth of NIH-3T3 cells in semisolid medium. Neither wild-type cyclin D1 nor the D1-KE triggered significant growth (Figure 6d). Although cell lines of passage 10 or greater expressing constitutively nuclear TA-KE and TR-KE were capable of growth in soft agar, growth, as assessed by colony number, was reduced by greater than 50% relative to both D1-T286A and D1-T286R, respectively (Figure 6d and e). As the KE-T286A mutant retained the ability to accelerate G1 progression (Figure 7d), their reduced transforming capacity cannot be attributed to defects in G1 progression. These data demonstrate that cyclin D1 mutants with compromised kinase activity are also compromised with respect to transforming potential.  To further investigate the mechanism underlying the retained kinase activity and assembly of the K114E cyclin D1 mutants with CDK4, we considered the possibility that association of D1-KE mutants with CDK4 in vivo was facilitated by a cellular cofactor. Indeed, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 have been shown to promote stable assembly of the cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase (LaBaer et al., 1997; Cheng et al., 1999). We used insect Sf9 cells, which express no detectable endogenous p21Cip1, to determine whether it facilitates the association of mutant cyclin D1 with CDK4. Sf9 were co-infected with baculovirus encoding wild-type cyclin D1 or D1-KE along with CDK4 and increasing concentrations of p21Cip1. Western analysis of the cyclin D1 immune complexes revealed markedly reduced levels of CDK4 in D1-KE relative to wild-type cyclin D1 precipitates in the absence of p21Cip1 (Figure 8a, compare lanes 4 and 10). Serial titration of the p21Cip1 baculovirus increased co-precipitation of CDK4 with either immunoprecipitated D1 or D1-KE.  Figure 8.

(a) Cyclin D1 complexes were immunoprecipitated from Sf9 lysates prepared following co-infection with either wild-type cyclin D1 or D1-KE along with CDK4 and increases concentrations of baculovirus encoding p21Cip1 using cyclin D1 antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitates were assayed for co-precipitated CDK4 and p21Cip1. Total immunoprecipitated cyclin D1 is confirmed by immunoblot using cyclin D1 antibody. (b) Following co-infection of CDK4 either with D1, D1-T286A or D1-KE in Sf9 cells, cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated using either M2 or cyclin D1 antibody and assayed for the ability to support Rb kinase activity.

Phosphorylated Rb was resolved by electrophoresis, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and visualized by autoradiography.  Full figure and legend (72K)  We subsequently investigated whether cyclin D1 KE–CDK4 complexes assembled by p21Cip1 in Sf9 cells were functionally active (Figure 8b and c). In the absence of p21Cip1, D1-KE retained severely reduced kinase activity (Figure 8b, lanes 4, 5 and 9, 10) relative to wild-type D1 (Figure 8b, lanes 2 and 7) but above that of controls (Figure 8b, lanes 1 and 6). Immunoblot for phospho-Ser780 Rb confirmed reduced Rb phosphorylation by mutant D1-KE. Co-expression of p21Cip1 increased CDK4 association with D1-KE (Figure 8a) and increased the kinase activity of the D1-KE holoenzyme (Figure 8c). Strikingly, whereas high concentrations of p21Cip1 rapidly inhibit wild-cyclin D1 activity, inhibition of D1-KE kinase activity by p21Cip1 is achieved only at the highest p21Cip1 concentrations (Figure 8a and c). These results indicate that in the absence of a physiologic assembly factor in vitro, a K114E mutant fails to associate with CDK4. However, expression of p21Cip1 in vivo or its supplementation in vitro is sufficient to maintain assembly of a KE cyclin D1–CDK4 complex, providing for attenuated yet sustained catalytic potential. As the K114E mutation does not result in differential association of cyclin D1 with the general transcriptional apparatus, our results suggest that reduced cellular transformation in the presence of a K114E mutation results from reduced nuclear CDK4 activation.  Top of page Discussion Previous work has suggested that phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of cyclin D1 is critical for the prevention of aberrant cell growth in vitro and in mouse models (Alt et al., 2000; Gladden et al., 2005). However, there is little data demonstrating the existence of cyclin D1 mutations that disrupt this regulatory process in human cancer. With the identification of critical regulatory residues within the C-terminus of cyclin D1 that maps to exon 5 of the cyclin D1 gene, we have identified and characterized mutations in cyclin D1 isolated from primary human cancer. We have identified an arginine for threonine substitution at position 286 in primary esophageal cancers, a histidine for threonine substitution at position 286 through an EST tag search, a deletion of amino acids 266–295 in primary esophageal cancer and a proline to alanine substitution at position 287, D1-P287A, identified in three independently derived esophageal cancer cell lines, TE3, TE7 and TE12. These mutations target residues responsible for Thr-286 phosphorylation and therefore, directly impact cyclin D1 nuclear export and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Characterization of the identified cyclin D1 mutants revealed wild-type properties with regard to association and activation of CDK4, suggesting that any oncogenic properties do not reflect an increased propensity to induce CDK activity. Rather, the impact of the mutations lies exclusively upon the constitutive nuclear accumulation of active cyclin D1/CDK complexes.  Several conclusions can be drawn regarding cyclin D1 alterations in cancer. First, mutations in the cyclin D1 coding region likely occur at a relatively low frequency, approx4% (four mutations identified in 110 samples including cell lines and primary tissue) in the current study. Although this figure is less than the estimated frequency of cyclin D1 overexpression in esophageal cancer, it is important to consider that B-Raf mutations have been estimated to occur only occur at an estimated frequency of 8% in human cancer (Davies et al., 2002; Garnett and Marais, 2004). Second, the mutations specifically disrupt CRM1 nuclear export resulting in the constitutive nuclear accumulation of an active cyclin D1/CDK4 kinase that is refractory to rapid degradation via the 26S proteasome. Finally, whereas this might argue against a generalized model wherein inactivation of cyclin D1 nuclear export contributes to cancer initiation, it is likely that this mutation frequency dramatically under-represents the actual frequency with which cyclin D1 nuclear export is targeted in human cancer. In point of fact, we have previously demonstrated that cancer-specific alternative splicing of cyclin D1 contributes to the expression of a constitutively nuclear cyclin D1 isoform; our work suggests that this isoform is expressed in approximately 40% of primary esophageal carcinomas (Lu et al., 2003).  Similar to our results, C-terminal cyclin D1 mutants were also identified in endometrial cancer (Moreno-Bueno et al., 2003) that map to residues adjacent to Thr-286. The in-frame deletion of residues 289–292 in D1-Delta289–292 deletes both a portion of the cyclin D1 nuclear export signal (Benzeno and Diehl, 2004) and a critical aspartic acid, D289, that is essential for subsequent phosphorylation of Thr-286 by GSK-3beta. As predicted from loss of both Thr-286 phosphorylation and deletion of the NES, D1-Delta289–292 accumulates in the nucleus and drives cellular transformation. Thus, cyclin D1 mutations isolated from both esophageal and endometrial cancer target the same regulatory sites important for nuclear export. Given that deregulation of cyclin D1 is proposed to contribute to the genesis and progression of additional cancers, it will be critical to expand this analysis to ascertain the potential contribution of cyclin D1 mutations to additional malignancies.  The GSK-3beta kinase targets two distinct sets of substrates, primed and unprimed. Canonically primed GSK-3beta substrates are characterized by a preceding phosphorylation event that is (n+4) residues from the target GSK-3beta phosphorylation site (n). This substrate priming event potentiates the alignment of beta- and alpha-helical domains within the positively charged binding groove of GSK-3beta and provides optimal coordination of the target phosphorylation residue within the catalytic cleft of this kinase (Dajani et al., 2001; ter Haar et al., 2001). Examples of primed GSK-3beta substrates include glycogen synthase, cyclin E, c-myc and NFAT (Fiol et al., 1988, 1990; Beals et al., 1997; Sears et al., 2000; Welcker et al., 2003, 2004). Unprimed GSK-3beta substrates include the I-2 inhibitor of PP1 and beta-catenin (Hagen et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2003).  As a canonical priming phosphorylation event that is characterized by the transfer of a phosphate group at position (n+4) is not required to initiate GSK-3beta-mediated phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286, the classification of cyclin D1 as an 'unprimed' GSK-3beta substrate is appropriate at face value (Diehl et al., 1998). Our data, on the other hand, suggest that recognition of cyclin D1 by GSK-3beta requires an acidic residue at the (n+3) position (Asp-289); the negative charge provided by Asp-289 may in fact substitute for a canonical priming phosphorylation event at (n+4). Indeed, aspartic acid 289 is conserved in both mouse and human cyclin D1 and is spatially conserved in all three D-type cyclins, highlighting its significance. Mutation Asp-289 to a non-charged residue or its deletion inhibits Thr-286 phosphorylation. Previous work has revealed that a specific peptide inhibitor, GID, preferentially inhibits GSK-3beta phosphorylation of unprimed substrates such as I-2 (Hedgepeth et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2003). Consistent with GSK-3beta recognizing cyclin D1 as a primed substrate (Hedgepeth et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 2003), phosphorylation of cyclin D1 by GSK-3beta is insensitive to the GID peptide inhibitor. These data strongly support the idea that D289 facilitates recognition and phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 and may do so via providing the negative charge generally provided by phosphorylation at the (n+4) position.  Nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1 during S phase correlates with its oncogenic capacity and ascribes a gain-of-function activity to cancer-derived, nuclear export-defective cyclin D1 mutants. The precise nature of cyclin D1's nuclear S-phase function remains unclear but may be related to the formation of active complexes with CDK4. Alternatively, there is evidence for the CDK-independent functions of cyclin D1 as well (Hirai and Sherr, 1996; Neuman et al., 1997; Zwijsen et al., 1997; Lamb et al., 2000; Petre et al., 2002; Benzeno et al., 2004). With the advent of anticancer therapeutics that target the active site of cyclin-dependent kinases, it is critical to discern between CDK-dependent versus CDK-independent functions (Fry et al., 2001, 2004). To begin to address the contribution of cyclin D1 kinase activity in cell transformation, we investigated the potential of a K114E mutation in the context of constitutively nuclear TA-KE and TR-KE, to affect cellular transformation in vitro. The K114E mutation had previously been reported as 'kinase-dead' owing to its failure to bind CDK4 in vitro (Hinds et al., 1994). In contrast, we found that in cells this mutant cyclin D1 associates with both CDK4 and p21Cip1 but is characterized by an attenuated and thus, hypomorphic capacity to activate CDK4 catalytic activity. Although not 'kinase-dead', we used these compound mutants as a tool to evaluate the effect of attenuated cyclin D1 activity on transforming potential. Our results reveal that the attenuated activity of constitutively nuclear T286A-KE and T286R-KE correlates with a significant reduction in transformation relative to wild-type counterparts, T286A and T286R, as assessed by anchorage-independent growth. Our data provide strong evidence that transformation by cyclin D1 is driven by its constitutive nuclear retention. Our results along with recently published work from the Sicinski and Hinds laboratories (Landis et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2006) also suggest that neoplastic growth is the direct result of unrestricted catalytic activity.  Although cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in human cancer, it is only weakly oncogenic in vitro or in mouse model systems. In contrast, we have demonstrated that cyclin D1 mutants that are refractory to nuclear export exhibit an enhanced capacity to trigger a cell transformation in vitro. We have recently demonstrated that transgenic expression of the constitutively nuclear mutant cyclin D1-T286A in murine lymphocytes triggers an aggressive B-cell lymphoma (Gladden et al., 2005). This is again in contrast to wild-type cyclin D1 expression of which is not sufficient to trigger B-cell malignancies in mice (Bodrug et al., 1994; Lovec et al., 1994a). Interpreted in sum, we suggest that overexpression of wild-type cyclin D1, although providing a growth advantage and contributing to the proliferative potential of tumor cells, is not in fact a transforming event. In contrast, in cases where cyclin D1 contributes to cancer initiation, accumulating data suggests that cells will exhibit defects in cyclin D1 nuclear export. These defects could result from mutations that impact the GSK-3beta phosphoacceptor site (data herein), induce alternative splicing of cyclin D1 (Lu et al., 2003) or via upstream mutations that impact the signal-transduction pathway that regulates Thr-286 phosphorylation (Rimerman et al., 2000).  In conclusion, our results emphasize the need for further investigation into the downstream mechanism(s) by which oncogenic mutants of cyclin D1 drive neoplastic growth. The results provided by these experiments will increase our understanding of the contribution of cyclin D1/CDK activity to cyclin D1 transformation in human neoplasia and expand our knowledge of downstream regulators including novel substrates that potentiate the oncogenicity of a constitutively active cyclin D1 mutant protein.  GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at Thr-286 promotes the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of cyclin D1 during S phase of the cell cycle, but how phosphorylation regulates redistribution has not been resolved. For example, phosphorylation of nuclear cyclin D1 could increase its rate of nuclear export relative to nuclear import; alternatively, phosphorylation of cytoplasmic cyclin D1 by GSK-3β could inhibit nuclear import. Here, we report that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation promotes cyclin D1 nuclear export by facilitating the association of cyclin D1 with the nuclear exportin CRM1. D1-T286A, a cyclin D1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by GSK-3β, remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle, a consequence of its reduced binding to CRM1. Constitutive overexpression of the nuclear cyclin D1-T286A in murine fibroblasts results in cellular transformation and promotes tumor growth in immune compromised mice. Thus, removal of cyclin D1 from the nucleus during S phase appears essential for regulated cell division.  Keywords: cyclin D1, GSK-3β, CRM1, tumorigenesis, nuclear export During G1 phase, the D-type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) accumulate and assemble with either cyclin-dependent kinase 4 or 6 (CDK4 or CDK6) in response to mitogenic growth factors. The active cyclin D holoenzyme promotes G1 progression by inactivating the growth-suppressive properties of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) through site-specific phosphorylation and by virtue of its ability to titrate CDK inhibitors such as p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 (Weinberg 1995; Sherr and Roberts 1999). Titration of p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, in turn, facilitates activation of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex and subsequent entry and progression through the DNA synthetic (S) phase of the cell cycle. Although p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 are effective inhibitors of cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin A/CDK2 complexes, recent evidence demonstrates that they promote the assembly of cyclin D/CDK complexes (LaBaer et al. 1997) and are found in catalytically active cyclin D/CDK complexes in vivo (Cheng et al. 1999).  Extracellular mitogens promote cellular proliferation via receptor-mediated signaling circuitry that ultimately converges on the cell cycle machine, and the D-type cyclins function as critical sensors of these signals. For example, receptor-dependent activation of Ras promotes the accumulation of active cyclin D1/CDK4 complexes via at least two pathways. First, activated Ras promotes transcription of the cyclin D1 gene through a kinase cascade involving Raf1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), and the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (Albanese et al. 1995; Aktas et al. 1997; Lavoie et al. 1996; Winston et al. 1996; Kerkhoff and Rapp 1997; Weber et al. 1997). Assembly and activation of the cyclin D1/CDK4 holoenzyme are also augmented by this same pathway (Cheng et al. 1998). Second, the rate of cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation is mediated by GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of a single threonine residue (Thr-286) near the C terminus of cyclin D1 (Diehl et al. 1998). Mitogens inactivate GSK-3β via a pathway involving Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase B/Akt (Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 1994, 1997; Franke et al. 1995, 1997; Klinghoffer et al. 1996; Kauffmann-Zeh et al. 1997; Vanhaesebroeck et al. 1997). Maximal accumulation of the active cyclin D1/CDK4 holoenzyme requires activation of both Ras-dependent signaling pathways.  Alterations in the subcellular distribution of cyclin D1 during the cell cycle may also regulate cyclin D1/CDK4 function. Cyclin D1 accumulates in the nucleus throughout G1 phase, but it relocalizes to the cytoplasm during the remainder of interphase (Baldin et al. 1993; Diehl et al. 1998). Like its proteolysis, the cell cycle–specific redistribution of cyclin D1 correlates with its phosphorylation on Thr-286 by GSK-3β (Diehl et al. 1998). Overexpression of GSK-3β redirects nuclear cyclin D1 to the cytoplasm (Diehl et al. 1998). Likewise, a mutant cyclin D1 protein containing an alanine-for-threonine substitution at residue 286 (D1-T286A) remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle and is not subject to GSK-3β-dependent redistribution (Diehl et al. 1998). Thus, it has been proposed that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation facilitates cyclin D1 nuclear export. Consistent with this notion, GSK-3β is excluded from the nucleus during G1 phase, whereas a fraction of total GSK-3β gains access to the nuclear compartment during S phase (Diehl et al. 1998). However, it is equally plausible that cytoplasmic GSK-3β phosphorylates cytosolic cyclin D1, thereby inhibiting cyclin D1 nuclear import.  Although cyclin D1 was initially cloned from a translocation break point associated with parathyroid adenoma, it is now clear that overexpression of nuclear cyclin D1 occurs at a high frequency in a variety of carcinomas, including those of breast, esophageal, and pancreatic origin (Sherr 1996). Work involving the development of mice expressing a cyclin D1 transgene indicates that cyclin D1 indeed has oncogenic capacity. Mice programmed to overexpress cyclin D1 in mammary tissue develop a protracted course of mammary neoplasia (Wang et al. 1994). In addition, overexpression of cyclin D1 in B cells augments c-Myc-induced lymphomagenesis (Bodrug et al. 1994; Lovec et al. 1994). However, immortal murine fibroblasts, which can be transformed by activated Ras, are not transformed upon overexpression of wild-type cyclin D1; cyclin D1 overexpressing cells require serum-derived mitogens for proliferation, remain contact inhibited, and do not grow in soft agar (Quelle et al. 1993). Therefore, overexpression of wild-type cyclin D1 is not sufficient to promote neoplastic transformation without cooperating mutations.  We now demonstrate that the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of cyclin D1 during S phase is mediated by CRM1-dependent nuclear export. Our results indicate that phosphorylation of Thr-286 activates cyclin D1 nuclear export by facilitating cyclin D1-CRM1 association. Furthermore, murine fibroblasts that overexpress cyclin D1-T286A display characteristics of morphologic transformation and promote tumor growth in mice, suggesting that nuclear exclusion of cyclin D1 complexes during S phase is a critical feature in the regulation of normal cellular proliferation.  Go to: Results Cyclin D1 is exported from the nucleus during S phase  The cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 during S phase depends on the presence of a phosphorylatable Thr-286 (Diehl et al. 1998), implying that phosphorylation of this residue could facilitate cyclin D1 nuclear export. To test this hypothesis, we rendered NIH-3T3 cells quiescent for 36 h by removing serum; subsequently, by adding fetal calf serum (FCS), we stimulated them to synchronously re-enter the cell cycle. Localization of cyclin D1 was determined either 8 h (late G1 phase) or 16 h (S phase) after serum addition. Before fixation and immunostaining with a cyclin D1–specific monoclonal antibody, the indicated S-phase cells were treated with leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent nuclear export (Nishi et al. 1994), for 2.5 h or with lithium chloride (LiCl), a specific inhibitor of GSK-3β (Stambolic et al. 1996), for 1 h. Cyclin D1 accumulated in the nucleus during G1 phase (Fig. (Fig.1A,1A, panel a) but relocalized to the cytoplasm during S phase (panel c). The cytoplasmic relocalization of cyclin D1 was inhibited by treatment with either LMB (panel e) or LiCl (panel g), suggesting that relocalization was dependent on active GSK-3β and active CRM1.  Figure 1 Figure 1 Nuclear export of cyclin D1 during S phase. (A) NIH-3T3 cells were arrested in G0 by serum deprivation for 36 h and subsequently stimulated to synchronously re-enter the cell cycle by addition of FCS. Cells were harvested and processed for immunofluorescence ... To confirm that LiCl treatment inhibited Thr-286 phosphorylation, we precipitated cyclin D1 from cyclin D1 overexpressing NIH-3T3 cells left untreated or treated with 20 mM LiCl. Precipitates were blotted with antibodies that specifically recognize either Thr-286 phosphorylated cyclin D1 (see Fig. Fig.5A5A below) or total cyclin D1. As shown in Figure Figure1B,1B, cells treated with LiCl did not express detectable levels of Thr-286 phosphorylated cyclin D1 (Fig. (Fig.1B,1B, P-286, cf. lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, LMB treatment, which inactivates CRM1, promoted the accumulation of nuclear (Fig. (Fig.1A,1A, panel e) Thr-286 phosphorylated cyclin D1 (Fig. (Fig.1B,1B, lane 6). Neither LMB nor LiCl affected cyclin D1/CDK4 complex formation (Fig. (Fig.1B,1B, CDK4). These results indicate that S-phase-specific nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of cyclin D1 is positively regulated by Thr-286 phosphorylation and is the result of CRM1-dependent nuclear export.  Figure 5 Figure 5 Thr-286 phosphorylation promotes cyclin D1-CRM1 binding. (A) Purified Flag-D1 phosphorylated with recombinant GSK-3β (lanes 1, 3), Flag-D1 treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (lane 2), or Flag-D1-T286A (lane 4) was separated on denaturing ... Leptomycin B inhibits GSK-3β-dependent relocalization of cyclin D1  Overexpression of GSK-3β promotes the stoichiometric redistribution of cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, independent of cell cycle stage (Diehl et al. 1998). Mutation of the site of GSK-3β phosphorylation within cyclin D1 to alanine (D1-T286A) prevents both GSK-3β-dependent and S-phase-dependent nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of cyclin D1 such that the D1-T286A mutant is constitutively nuclear (Diehl et al. 1998). This redistribution of cyclin D1 could result from either phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of nuclear import or activation of nuclear export. The inhibitor experiments (Fig. (Fig.1)1) supported the notion that redistribution of cyclin D1 during S phase is the result of nuclear export. We therefore determined if GSK-3β-dependent relocalization of cyclin D1 is indeed regulated by CRM1-dependent nuclear export.  NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged cyclin D1 and CDK4 alone or with vectors encoding either wild-type (wt)GSK-3β or a kinase-dead (kd)GSK-3β. Under our conditions of transfection, >60% of the cell population expressed ectopic protein (data not shown). Before immunofluorescence, the indicated cells were treated with 10 ng/mL LMB for 2.5 h to inactivate CRM1. The cells were then fixed, and the localization of cyclin D1 was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using the M2 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the N-terminal Flag epitope (Fig. (Fig.2A).2A). Cells expressing cyclin D1 were counted and scored for cyclin D1 localization (Fig. (Fig.2B).2B). As expected (Diehl and Sherr 1997), cyclin D1 localized primarily to nuclei under these conditions (Fig. (Fig.2A,2A, panel a). In contrast, co-transfection with a vector encoding wtGSK-3β (panel c) but not kdGSK-3β (panel g) promoted the redistribution of cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Quantitation revealed that cyclin D1 was primarily nuclear in <20% of the cells upon co-transfection with GSK-3β (Fig. (Fig.2B),2B), whereas in cells expressing only cyclin D1 and CDK4, the majority (80%) of cyclin D1 was nuclear (Fig. (Fig.2B).2B). In contrast, treatment of the cells co-expressing D1, CDK4, and wtGSK-3β with LMB completely restored cyclin D1 nuclear localization (Fig. (Fig.2A,2A, panel e, and B). The LMB-dependent inhibition of cyclin D1 nuclear export is likely the result of the inhibition of CRM1 activity because cyclin D1 is still phosphorylated at Thr-286 under these conditions (Fig. (Fig.1B).1B). Therefore, GSK-3β-mediated relocalization of cyclin D1 requires CRM-1-dependent nuclear export.  Figure 2 Figure 2 GSK-3β promotes cyclin D1 nuclear export. (A) Asynchronous NIH-3T3 cells transiently overexpressing Flag-D1 and CDK4 (panels a, b), Flag-D1, CDK4, and wtGSK-3β (panels c–f), or Flag-D1, CDK4, and kinase dead (kd)GSK-3β ... Cyclin D1 nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shuttling is dependent on CRM1 and GSK-3β  The above findings are consistent with the notion that GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of cyclin D1 on Thr-286 regulates its nuclear export. To further address this issue, we used an interspecies-heterokaryon shuttling assay. This assay relies on the fact that fused interphase cells maintain distinct nuclei within a contiguous cytoplasm until they enter M phase. By fusing cells from two different species, we can monitor the migration of proteins from one nucleus to another. For migration to occur, the cargo must undergo at least one round of nuclear export (from the original nucleus) and one round of nuclear import (into the heterologous nucleus). Because a protein that is defective for nuclear export will remain localized to the original nucleus, this assay can be used to assess the ability of a protein to undergo nuclear export.  For these experiments, nucleoplasmin containing a bi-directional transport signal (M9) and a c-Myc epitope tag (NPc-M9) was used as a positive control (Michael et al. 1995; Sachdev et al. 1998). NIH-3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding nucleoplasmin, wild-type cyclin D1, or D1-T286A. Thirty-six hours after transfection and 3 h before cellular fusion, HeLa cells were plated on top of the transfected NIH-3T3 cells and allowed to attach. Shuttling between nuclei was determined 30 min after cell fusion by indirect immunofluorescence using the 9E10 monoclonal antibody (NPc-M9) or either a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes murine cyclin D1 or the Flag-specific M2 monoclonal antibody. Murine and human nuclei were distinguished by staining with Hoechst dye 33258. The total number of heterokaryons displaying protein shuttling was quantitated (Fig. (Fig.3B),3B), and representative fusions are shown (Fig. (Fig.3A).3A). NPc-M9 was visualized in both the transfected NIH-3T3 nuclei and in nuclei of fused HeLa cells at a high frequency (Fig. (Fig.3A,3A, panel a; the frequency of NPc-M9 shuttling was arbitrarily set at 1 and used as a point of reference). Wild-type cyclin D1 was also visualized in both the transfected NIH-3T3 nuclei and the fused HeLa nuclei (Fig. (Fig.3A,3A, panel d) at a frequency comparable to that of NPc-M9 (Fig. (Fig.3B,3B, cf. bars NPc-M9 and D1). Addition of LMB inhibited cyclin D1 movement between mouse and human nuclei (Fig. (Fig.3A,3A, panel g, and B, bar D1 + LMB), consistent with the notion that cyclin D1 shuttling depends on functional CRM1. To assess the role of GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Thr-286 for cyclin D1 nuclear export, we determined the ability of LiCl, which inhibits GSK-3β, to block cyclin D1 shuttling. Treatment of cells with 20 mM LiCl significantly reduced cyclin D1 shuttling (Fig. (Fig.3B,3B, bar D1 + LiCl), as did mutation of Thr-286 to a nonphosphorylatable alanine residue (Fig. (Fig.3A,3A, panel j, and B, bar D1-T286A). Treatment of cells expressing D1-T286A with LiCl did not further reduce its shuttling (Fig. (Fig.3B,3B, bar D1-T286A + LiCl). Thus, GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-286 facilitates cyclin D1 nuclear export.  Figure 3 Figure 3 Phosphorylation of Thr-286 facilitates cyclin D1 nuclear shuttling. (A) NIH-3T3 cells proliferating on glass coverslips and transiently expressing nucleoplasmin, NPc-M9 (panels a–c), cyclin D1 and CDK4 without (panels d–f) or with LMB ... CRM1 regulates cyclin D1 nucleocytoplasmic movement  If CRM1 mediates nuclear export of Thr-286 phosphorylated cyclin D1, then overexpression of CRM1 should promote nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of cyclin D1. To test this hypothesis, we transfected NIH-3T3 cells with plasmids encoding cyclin D1 and CDK4 or cyclin D1, CDK4, and hemagglutinin antigen (HA)–tagged CRM1. In the absence of exogenous CRM1, cyclin D1 was predominantly nuclear (Fig. (Fig.4A,4A, panel a). However, co-expression of HA-CRM1 resulted in the relocalization of cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (panel c). In contrast, HA-CRM1 failed to relocalize D1-T286A to the cytoplasm (panel h), even though HA-CRM1 could be detected in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, consistent with the notion that Thr-286 phosphorylation is critical for cyclin D1 nuclear export.  Figure 4 Figure 4 CRM1 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1. (A) NIH-3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either wild-type cyclin D1 and CDK4 (panels a, b), cyclin D1, CDK4, and HA-CRM1 (panels c–e), D1-T286A and CDK4 (panels f, g), or ... We next considered whether phosphorylation of Thr-286 might promote cyclin D1 nuclear export via its propensity to facilitate cyclin D1-CRM1 association. To examine this possibility, we performed in vitro binding assays using purified recombinant proteins. Flag-D1 purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was either phosphorylated with GSK-3β in vitro or dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The presence of phosphorylated Thr-286 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for this phosphorylated residue (Fig. (Fig.5A).5A). Purified cyclin D1 proteins were then incubated with purified HA-CRM1, and complexes were isolated by precipitation with the HA-specific 12CA5 monoclonal antibody and blotted with either the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody or the anti-HA antibody. Both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cyclin D1 were capable of binding to CRM1 (Fig. (Fig.5B,5B, lanes 2, 4). However, within the nucleus, the binding of CRM1 to export substrates is facilitated by the small GTP-binding protein Ran, in its GTP-bound state, Ran-GTP (Askjaer et al. 1998). We thus tested whether the addition of Ran-GTP might differentially stimulate binding of phosphorylated versus dephosphorylated cyclin D1 to CRM1. Consistent with this notion, three- to fourfold more Thr-286 phosphorylated D1 than dephosphorylated D1 was detected in the HA-CRM1 precipitate in the presence of Ran-GTP (Fig. (Fig.5B,5B, cf. lanes 3 and 5). The binding of the D1-T286A mutant to HA-CRM1, like dephosphorylated D1, was not significantly enhanced by Ran-GTP (Fig. (Fig.5B,5B, lanes 6, 7). Therefore, Thr-286 phosphorylation of cyclin D1 facilitates cyclin D1-CRM1 binding under conditions of high Ran-GTP concentrations, as would be expected in the nucleus (Nigg 1997).  Cyclin D1-T286A promotes oncogenic transformation  Although cells engineered to overexpress cyclin D1 display a contracted G1 interval (Quelle et al. 1993; Resnitzky et al. 1994), these cells do not form foci, grow in soft agar, or promote tumor formation in immune-compromised mice (Quelle et al. 1993). However, even when expressed at high levels, ectopic cyclin D1 displays wild-type cell cycle–dependent subcellular localization (Diehl et al. 1998). Thus, the essentially normal characteristics of these cells may reflect their propensity to metabolize ectopically expressed cyclin D1. It was therefore reasonable to consider the possibility that failure to remove cyclin D1 from the nucleus during S phase might perturb cell homeostasis and promote cell transformation.  To test this hypothesis, we established NIH-3T3 cell lines that constitutively overexpress Flag epitope-tagged cyclin D1-T286A (D1-T286A-3T3) or wild-type Flag-D1 (D1-3T3) (Diehl et al. 1998). Pools of stable transfectants were subjected to an established passage protocol (Todaro and Green 1963), and various passages were analyzed for characteristics of cell transformation. Early passage ([passage 4–9] p4-p9) D1-T286A-3T3 and D1-3T3 cells were subject to contact inhibition and to growth arrest after growth factor removal (Diehl et al. 1998). To determine if long-term overexpression of cyclin D1-T286A promoted cell transformation, we examined the capacity of early versus late passage D1-3T3 and D1-T286A-3T3 cells to form foci; we found that neither early nor late passage D1-3T3 cells formed foci (Fig. (Fig.6A).6A). In contrast, late passage (p19) D1-T286A cells readily formed large numbers of foci (Fig. (Fig.6A).6A). Over the course of four independent experiments, cells overexpressing D1-T286A routinely formed foci after 18 passages, whereas D1-3T3 cells failed to form foci even after >40 passages (data not shown). Consistent with data from the focus formation assays is our finding that passage 18 or more D1-T286A-3T3 cells readily grew in soft agar, whereas wild-type NIH-3T3 and D1-3T3 cells were not capable of anchorage-independent growth (Fig. (Fig.6B).6B).  Figure 6 Figure 6 Cyclin D1-T286A promotes cellular transformation. (A) Early (p4) or late (p19) passage cell lines were plated in complete medium containing 5% FCS at 4 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. Cells were grown for an additional 21 d, ... To address whether fibroblasts that overexpressed D1-T286A are tumorigenic, D1-T286A-3T3 cells were tested for their ability to form subcutaneous tumors in SCID mice. As shown in Table Table1,1, 7 out of 7 mice injected with passage 23 D1-T286A-3T3 cells formed tumors within 22 d, whereas 7 of 7 mice injected with RasVal12-3T3 cells developed tumors within 10 d. In addition, even early passage D1-T286A-expressing cells formed tumors, albeit at a protracted rate (Table (Table1).1). Similar to the in vitro transformation assays, neither early nor late passage NIH-3T3 nor D1-3T3 cells were able to form tumors (Table (Table1).1). To ensure that colonies that formed in soft agar and tumors that arose in SCID mice expressed D1-T286A, soft agar colonies were picked and expanded in vitro (Fig. (Fig.6C,6C, lane 2), and whole-cell protein lysates were prepared. In parallel, protein lysates were prepared from tumors that arose in SCID mice injected with early (T9-1 and -2; Fig. Fig.6C,6C, lanes 3, 4) or late passage (T23-3 and -4; Fig. Fig.6C,6C, lanes 5, 6) D1-T286A-3T3 cells. Cyclin D1 was precipitated from lysates, resolved on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to membrane. Immunoblot analysis with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody confirmed that D1-T286A was expressed at comparable levels in both cloned cell lines and in the tumor samples (Fig. (Fig.6C,6C, lanes 2–7).  Table 1 Table 1 In vivo tumor growth of D1-T286A expressing cells We have previously shown that D1-T286A remains exclusively nuclear throughout the cell cycle (Diehl et al. 1998), unlike wild-type cyclin D1, which is cytoplasmic in S phase (see Fig. Fig.1).1). To confirm that D1-T286A was still a nuclear protein in tumor-derived cells, we established cell lines from the D1-T286A-induced tumors. The localization of D1-T286A in G1- or S-phase cells for one such tumor-derived cell line is shown in Figure Figure6D.6D. As previously shown (Diehl et al. 1998), the D1-T286A protein was nuclear during G1 and S phase in the D1-T286A-3T3 cells (Fig. (Fig.6D,6D, panels a, c). The D1-T286A protein was also nuclear in tumor-derived cells during both G1 and S phase (Fig. (Fig.6D,6D, panels e, g).  Because the D1-T286A mutant has a half-life approximately sevenfold longer than wild-type cyclin D1 (Diehl et al. 1997), the differential growth properties of the D1-3T3 versus D1-T286A-3T3 could reflect different levels of the respective cyclin D1 proteins. Ectopic D1 and D1-T286A can be distinguished from endogenous cyclin D1 as a result of the presence of the N-terminal Flag epitope, which results in the reduced mobility of ectopic cyclin D1 (Diehl et al. 1997). Whole-cell lysates were prepared from either parental NIH-3T3, D1-3T3, or D1-T286A-3T3 cells and blotted with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody. Both early and late passage D1-3T3 and D1-T286A-3T3 cells expressed equivalent levels of the respective Flag-tagged D1 proteins (Fig. (Fig.7A).7A). In agreement, cyclin D1 complexes precipitated from the respective cell lines phosphorylated recombinant Rb to the same extent in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. (Fig.7B).7B).  Figure 7 Figure 7 Cellular transformation correlates with constitutive nuclear accumulation of cyclin D1-T286A. (A) Whole-cell lysates prepared from early (p11) or late (p18) NIH-3T3 or derivatives overexpressing either wild-type cyclin D1 or D1-T286A were subjected to ... Given the extended half-life of the D1-T286A protein relative to wild-type cyclin D1, we presumed that the steady-state levels of each protein in the respective cell lines must reflect biosynthetic rate (which is determined by plasmid uptake during the transfection to establish the cell lines). To confirm this, D1-3T3 and D1-T286A-3T3 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and cyclin D1 was precipitated from cellular lysates and resolved on a polyacrylamide gel. Significantly more radiolabeled cyclin D1 was synthesized during the course of this experiment than was D1-T286A (Fig. (Fig.7C,7C, cf. lanes 2–4 with 5–7), which is consistent with the idea that the high level of accumulation of wild-type cyclin D1 results from its increased synthesis. The fact that there appears to be an upper limit for total protein accumulation, be it wild-type or mutant D1, likely reflects the fact that overexpression of cyclin D1 can be associated with apoptosis (Sofer-Levi and Resnitzky 1996).  These results suggest that the differential growth of the D1-T286A-3T3 cells was not simply the result of increased levels of the D1-T286A protein. Oncogenic transformation, particularly that which targets the p53 pathway, is frequently associated with genomic instability (Levine 1997). However, analysis of the cellular DNA content by flow cytometry revealed that the transformed D1-T286A cell lines remained pseudo-diploid (Fig. (Fig.7D).7D). Therefore, D1-T286A-dependent transformation does not appear to be associated with cellular aneuploidy.  Go to: Discussion Regulation of cyclin D1 nuclear export by phosphorylation  GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-286 promotes the stoichiometric redistribution of wild-type cyclin D1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during S phase (Diehl et al. 1998). Consistent with this finding, a cyclin D1 mutant containing an alanine for threonine substitution at residue 286 (D1-T286A) remains nuclear throughout the cell cycle and is not subject to GSK-3β-dependent regulation (Diehl et al. 1998). We considered two possible models that address the mechanism whereby phosphorylation of Thr-286 modulates cyclin D1 localization (Diehl et al. 1998). In the first, phosphorylation of nuclear cyclin D1 increases its rate of nuclear export relative to nuclear import. In the second model, GSK-3β phosphorylates cytoplasmic cyclin D1, thereby inhibiting cyclin D1 nuclear import.  The experimental data provided here support the first model. Treatment of cells with LMB, an inhibitor of the nuclear export receptor CRM1, inhibited GSK-3β-dependent nucleo-cytoplasmic redistribution of cyclin D1. Using heterokaryon shuttling assays, we found that cyclin D1 shuttled between heterologous nuclei. Cyclin D1 shuttling was inhibited by LMB, demonstrating that movement represented at least one round of nuclear export. In addition, cyclin D1 shuttling was reduced by inhibiting GSK-3β or by mutation of Thr-286 to alanine. We also found that S-phase-specific nuclear-to-cytoplasmic movement of cyclin D1 was prevented by inhibition of GSK-3β (LiCl treatment) or CRM1 (LMB treatment), thereby implicating phosphorylation-dependent nuclear export of cyclin D1 during S phase. Finally, overexpression of CRM1 promotes the cytoplasmic localization of cyclin D1 under conditions in which cyclin D1 is normally nuclear. Once again, CRM1-dependent relocalization of cyclin D1 was dependent on the presence of Thr-286, because D1-T286A remained nuclear even in the presence of overexpressed wild-type GSK-3β and CRM1. These data demonstrate that localization of cyclin D1 is at least in part determined by the efficiency of nuclear export. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr-286 appears to act as a required switch that facilitates cyclin D1 nuclear export such that cyclin D1 is predominantly cytoplasmic during S phase of the cell cycle.  CRM1 regulates cyclin D1 nuclear export  Transit of proteins between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments occurs via nuclear pores (Nigg 1997; Gorlich 1998). For cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation through the nuclear pore, proteins must first interact with soluble, cytoplasmic import factors (importins), followed by the docking of this complex to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear pore. The mechanisms governing nuclear export are analogous, with nuclear export substrates binding to soluble, nuclear export factors (exportins). CRM1 is one such exportin that binds to leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NES) (Fornerod et al. 1997; Fukada et al. 1997; Stade et al. 1997). CRM1 likely mediates nuclear export of several cell cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclin B1 (Yang et al. 1998), CDC25 (Lopez-Girona et al. 1999), and p27Kip1 (Tomoda et al. 1999), and the data presented here demonstrate that cyclin D1 should be added to this list.  Site-specific phosphorylation can either positively or negatively regulate nuclear export. For example, phosphorylation of Pho4 is necessary for association with its nuclear exportin, Msn5 (Kaffman et al. 1998). Analogous with Pho4, two observations herein suggest that phosphorylation of Thr-286 regulates cyclin D1-CRM1 association and thereby determines the rate of cyclin D1 nuclear export. First, CRM1-dependent nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of cyclin D1 is dependent on active GSK-3β and on the presence of phosphorylatable Thr-286. Second, the physical association of cyclin D1 and CRM1 was greatly enhanced by Thr-286 phosphorylation. Overall, these data provide direct evidence that phosphorylation of Thr-286 facilitates the binding of cyclin D1 with CRM1 and thereby promotes cyclin D1 nuclear export.  The binding of CRM1 to a leucine-rich NES within the cargo is an early step in the nuclear export process (Gorlich 1998). Because the exact spacing of the leucine/hydrophobic residues within each substrate is subject to variation, it can be difficult to define an NES signal on this basis alone (Nigg 1997). Examination of cyclin D1 revealed two sequences that closely resemble characterized NES signals. The first is located within the “cyclin box” from residues 87–94 (RFLSLEPL), and the second is located at the C terminus beginning with Thr-286 (TPTDVRDVDI). Deletion of either of these sequences alone was not sufficient to abolish CRM1-dependent nuclear-to-cytoplasmic relocalization of cyclin D1 (negative data not shown). The possibility remains that cyclin D1 may have more than one functional NES, as has been demonstrated for the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor (Henderson 2000; Neufeld et al. 2000; Rosen-Arbesfeld et al. 2000). Accordingly, removal of any one NES would not be sufficient to abolish CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Alternately, D1-CRM1 binding may be mediated by a novel type of interaction. Further investigation of cyclin D1-CRM1 binding is clearly warranted.  Constitutively nuclear cyclin D1-T286A promotes cell transformation  The capacity of the cell to direct nuclear import of cyclin D1 during G1 phase and nuclear export during S phase suggests that movement of cyclin D1 must be considered bi-directional. Consequently, cyclin D1 subcellular distribution is in fact an equilibrium established between nuclear import and nuclear export. The observed overexpression of nuclear cyclin D1 in a variety of cancers (Hall and Peters 1996; Sherr 1996) suggests that its overexpression provides cells with a distinct growth advantage. The development of mammary hyperplasia and cancer in mice bearing a cyclin D1 transgene is consistent with this hypothesis (Wang et al. 1994). Yet, cell lines engineered to overexpress wild-type cyclin D1 remain growth factor dependent and fail to exhibit overt signs of cell transformation (Quelle et al. 1993; Resnitzky et al. 1994). Thus, cyclin D1 overexpression by itself is not sufficient to promote uncontrolled cell growth. In contrast, we have shown that the constitutively nuclear cyclin D1-T286A protein promotes cell transformation. This single-point mutation alters two known properties of cyclin D1. First, D1-T286A is resistant to polyubiquitination, resulting in an extended half-life relative to wild-type cyclin D1 (Diehl et al. 1997). Second, this mutation inhibits the nuclear export of cyclin D1 during S phase (data herein). The steady-state levels of wild-type versus mutant cyclin D1 are comparable in the respective cell lines, resulting in roughly equivalent levels of D-type cyclin kinase activity (Fig. (Fig.7).7). Therefore, increased protein stability is likely not the primary contributor to cell transformation by D1-T286A. Rather, the oncogenicity of D1-T286A correlates with its constitutive nuclear localization.  These observations highlight the possibility that the tolerance of cells to wild-type cyclin D1 may reflect their ability to “restrain” cyclin D1 through regulation of its subcellular localization. In fact, the subcellular localization of overexpressed wild-type cyclin D1 mirrors that of endogenous cyclin D1 (Diehl et al. 1998), being nuclear in G1 and cytoplasmic during S phase. This is significant given that the critical functions of cyclin D1 are nuclear (Sherr 1996).  What then is the mechanism whereby D1-T286A promotes cell transformation? The cyclin D1/CDK4 complex is thought to regulate cell cycle progression via its propensity to promote Rb phosphorylation. However, the presence of D1-T286A/CDK4 complexes in the nucleus during S phase suggests that it could function downstream of Rb. One possibility is that the inability of a cell to eliminate nuclear cyclin D1 during S phase perturbs the fidelity of DNA synthesis, perhaps the result of phosphorylation of proteins that are normally substrates of the CDK2 kinase. High-fidelity DNA replication depends on appropriate timing and activation of the DNA replication machinery (Krude et al. 1997). The cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin A/CDK2 kinases play an active role in regulating and activating DNA synthesis. Phosphorylation of these substrates by the D1-T286A/CDK4 kinase could result in the premature or inappropriate activation of these CDK2 substrates. Implicit to this model is the possibility that D1-T286A-dependent transformation occurs downstream of Rb phosphorylation and thus may be Rb independent. The capacity of cyclin D1–dependent kinase to promote S-phase entry independent of Rb phosphorylation is consistent with this notion (Leng et al. 1997). Furthermore, it has been reported that wild-type cyclin D1 can promote focal gene amplification in cells containing wild-type p53 (Zhou et al. 1996). Although our analysis reveals that D1-T286A cells remain diploid and do not show overt signs of genetic instability, it is possible that expression of D1-T286A leads to specific gene amplification events undetectable by fluorescence-activated cell sorting.  Alternately, the constitutively nuclear D1-T286A/CDK4 complex may perturb the normal temporal and spatial course of the Rb phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle. The growth-suppressive activity of Rb is intimately associated with its ability to bind to and inactivate a large number of growth-promoting proteins, including members of the E2F family of transcription factors (Lees et al. 1993), Myc family proteins (Rustgi et al. 1991), and even proteins that directly participate in DNA replication such as MCM7 (Sterner et al. 1998). Phosphorylation of Rb triggers the release of these bound proteins, thereby permitting activation of their growth-promoting functions. Dephosphorylation of Rb during mitosis is an important step in the re-activation of Rb and likely serves to reset the cell cycle clock for the ensuing G1 interval. Perturbation of either phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of Rb through overexpression of D1-T286A would likely perturb the critical temporal and spatial timing of Rb-dependent growth control, resulting in neoplastic growth.  Cyclin D1 and human neoplasia  There have been no reported mutations at Thr-286 of cyclin D1 in human neoplasia. However, overexpression of cyclin D1 in certain tumors cannot be explained by gene amplification or chromosomal rearrangements. In these tumors, it is reasonable to propose that the regulatory circuitry controlling cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation is deregulated. For example, in patients having colorectal adenocarcinoma and in mice bearing intestinal adenomas, high levels of nuclear cyclin D1 are observed, with no apparent genetic abnormalities in the cyclin D1 gene (Hall and Peters 1996; Sherr 1996). Inactivating mutations in the APC tumor suppressor, a target of Wnt signaling pathways (Kinzler and Vogelstein 1996) occurs with a high frequency in such carcinomas (Powell et al. 1992). The demonstration that deregulation of Wnt-dependent signaling promotes overexpression of nuclear cyclin D1 and cooperates with activated MEK1 in cell transformation (Rimerman et al. 2000) supports the concept that cellular defects that impinge on cyclin D1 subcellular localization contribute to oncogenesis. These observations, coupled with the ability of constitutively nuclear D1-T286A to promote cellular transformation, raise the intriguing possibility that deregulation of cyclin D1 localization may be a previously unappreciated contributor to human neoplasia.  Go to: Materials and methods Cell culture conditions and transfections  NIH-3T3 cells and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing glutamine supplemented with antibiotics (Cellgro) and 10% FCS (BioWhitaker). Insect Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. For expression in insect Sf9 cells, HA-tagged CRM1 was inserted into pVL1393 as an SmaI-NotI fragment. Procedures for manipulation of baculoviruses were previously described (Summers and Smith 1987). Derivatives of NIH-3T3 cells engineered to overexpress flag-tagged cyclin D1 and flag-tagged cyclin D1-T286A were previously described (Diehl et al. 1998). Cell lines were maintained on a passage protocol wherein 5 × 109 cells were passaged per 60-mm dish every third day (Todaro and Green 1963). Transient expression of Myc-tagged GSK-3β and Flag-tagged cyclin D1 in NIH-3T3 cells or Flag-tagged cyclin D1 along with HA-tagged CRM1 was performed as previously described (Diehl et al. 1998). For determination of cellular DNA content, cells were trypsinized, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry.  Immunoblotting and kinase assays  For Western analysis, cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5 % NP-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [PMSF], 20 U/mL aprotinin, 5 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.4 mM NaVO4, 0.4 mM NaF). Total cellular proteins (200 μg) were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (tumor lysates were subjected to precipitation with the cyclin D1 antibody before electrophoresis), electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (MSI, Westborough, MA), and blotted with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (D1-17-13G). For detection of cyclin D1–dependent kinase activity, cells were harvested in Tween 20 IP buffer (50 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mM PMSF, 20 U/mL aprotinin, 5 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.4 mM NaVO4, 0.4 mM NaF). After precipitation with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody, protein kinase assays using 1 μg of recombinant GST-Rb were performed as previously described (Diehl and Sherr 1997; Rimerman et al. 2000).  Biosynthetic labeling  Subconfluent cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-free DMEM (BioWhittaker) and shifted to medium containing 200 μCi/mL Tran-35S-label (ICN) for the indicated periods of time. Proteins were precipitated from cell lysates normalized for total protein concentration with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody, and radiolabeled proteins were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography.  Expression and purification of proteins  HA-CRM1 and Flag-D1 were cloned into the pVDL-1393 baculoviral expression vector (Pharmingen), and virus was isolated according to established procedures (Summers and Smith 1987). After infection of insect Sf9 cells at high multiplicity, cells were lysed in EBC buffer and clarified by sedimentation in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography with antibodies that recognize either the HA or Flag epitope tags. HA-CRM1 was left attached to Sepharose beads for use in the in vitro interaction assays. Before the elution of Flag-D1 from beads with excess Flag peptide, Flag-D1 was either dephosphorylated by treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase for 15 min at 30°C or mixed with recombinant GSK-3β and ATP as previously described (Diehl et al. 1998) to ensure stoichiometric phosphorylation of Thr-286.  A pQE32-derived expression vector encoding a hexahistidine-tagged canine Ran cDNA was introduced into BLR[pRep4] cells. The cells were grown to an O.D. of 0.5, and expression of Ran was induced by the addition of 1mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mM PMSF, 5 μg/mL each of antipain, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor). The cells were lysed by gentle sonication and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000g. The supernatant was passed over a metal-chelate affinity column (Invitrogen) and washed with lysis buffer containing 60 mM imidazole. The bound proteins were eluted with 450 mM imidazole and dialyzed against 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), 160 mM potassium acetate, 5 mM magnesium acetate containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM PMSF.  In vitro interaction assays  HA-CRM1 coupled to 12CA5-protein A Sepharose was mixed with purified cyclin D1 in the absence or presence of RanGTP and incubated at 4°C for 2 h. Complexes were washed four times with Tween 20 IP buffer and denatured in sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore), and blotted with the cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (D1-17-13G). Sites of antibody binding were visualized with either protein-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP; EY Laboratories), anti-mouse-conjugated HRP, or anti-rabbit-conjugated HRP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  Immunofluorescence  NIH-3T3 cells seeded on glass coverslips were transfected with expression vectors encoding the indicated DNAs. Cells were fixed at 48 h after transfection, using either 3% paraformaldehyde or methanol-acetone (1:1). For visualization of cyclin D1 in the interspecies heterokaryons, coverslips were stained with either a mouse-specific cyclin D1 monoclonal antibody (D1-17-13G) or the Flag-specific M2 monoclonal (Sigma) in PBS containing 1% dry milk. Secondary antibody staining was performed for 30 min using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated anti-mouse (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For visualization of Flag-tagged cyclin D1 and HA-tagged CRM1 in the same cell, cells were stained with a goat antibody specific for the Flag epitope (10 μg/mL) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by rabbit anti-goat (10 μg/mL) and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:100). HA-CRM1 was detected by staining with the 12CA5 mouse monoclonal (10 μg/mL) followed by biotinylated anti-mouse (1:500) and subsequently streptavidin Texas Red (1:500). In all cases, DNA was visualized using Hoescht 33258 dye at a 1:500 dilution. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories).  Interspecies heterokaryon assay  NIH-3T3 cells plated at 5 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish on glass coverslips at 8 h before transfection with expression vectors encoding CDK4 along with either cyclin D1 or the D1-T286A mutant. After 48 h, HeLa cells were seeded on top of the transfected NIH-3T3 cells at 3 × 106 cells per dish and allowed to attach for 3 h. Cycloheximide was added at 50 μg/mL at 5 min before fusion. Cellular fusions were induced with 50% polyethylene glycol 8000 for 1 min 53 sec. Coverslips were placed back in media containing cycloheximide for 30 min and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. Cyclin D1 localization was visualized by immunofluorescence, as indicated above. In certain experiments, LMB was added to media at 50 μg/mL or 20 mM LiCl after co-culture with HeLa cells.  Cell transformation and tumorgenicity assays  Early and late passage NIH-3T3 cell lines were plated at 3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish. After attachment, cells were cultured in media containing 5% FCS. Foci were visualized after 21 d with Wright Giemsa stain (Sigma). Anchorage-dependent growth of early and late passage NIH-3T3, D1-3T3, and D1-T286A-3T3 was determined by analyzing cellular growth in semisolid medium. Five thousand cells were placed in Iscove's media containing 0.65% noble agar containing 10% FCS. Cells were allowed to grow for 3 wk in 8% CO2 , and we analyzed formation of colonies containing >50 cells. Individual colonies were picked, expanded, and analyzed for expression of Flag-D1-T286A by Western analysis. For experiments examining tumor formation in SCID mice, cells were harvested by trypsinization and washed extensively in PBS. Ten million cells were then resuspended in 0.2 mL of PBS and injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 6-wk-old male SCID mice (Charles River).      1\n",
       "Activating mutations of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRA) are known to be alternative and mutually exclusive genetic events in the development of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We examined the effect of the mutations of these two genes on the gene expression profile of 22 GISTs using the oligonucleotide microarray. Mutations of KITand PDGFRA were found in 17 cases and three cases, respectively. The remaining two cases had no detectable mutations in either gene. The mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA was directly related to the expression levels of activated KITand PDGFRA, and was also related to the different expression levels of activated proteins that play key roles in the downstream of the receptor tyrosine kinase III family. To evaluate the impact of mutation status and the importance of the type of mutation in gene expression and clinical features, microarray-derived data from 22 GISTs were interpreted using a principal component analysis (PCA). Three relevant principal component representing mutation of KIT, PDGFRA and chromosome 14q deletion were identified from the interpretation of the oligonucleotide microarray data with PCA. After supervised analysis, there was at least a two fold difference in expression between GISTs with KIT and PDGFRA mutation in 70 genes. Our findings demonstrate that mutations of KIT and PDGFRA affect differential activation and expression of some genes, and can be used for the molecular classification of GISTs. Oncogene (2005) 24, 1066–1074. doi:10.1038/sj.onc.1208358 Published online 27 December 2004 Keywords: gastrointestinal stromal tumors; KIT; PDGFRA; molecular classification; oligonucleotide microarray Introduction Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract (Lewin et al., 1992; Fletcher et al., 2002). The constituent tumor cells are similar morphologically and immunohistochemically to the interstitial cells of Cajal (Hirota et al., 1998; Kindblom et al., 1998), thus suggesting that GISTs originate from stem cells that differentiate toward ICCs. Recent molecular genetic studies have demonstrated that gain-of-function mutations of the v-kit Hardy– Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) proto-oncogene, a member of receptor tyrosine kinase III family (Besmer et al., 1986), are the most frequent and important changes in the development of GISTs (Besmer et al., 1986; Hirota et al., 1998; Nakahara et al., 1998). Mutations in KIT result in ligand-independent kinase activity and autophosphorylation of KIT (Kitayama et al., 1995; Ma et al., 1999). The KIT mutation is known to be present in 41 to 92% of GISTs (Lasota et al., 1999; Taniguchi et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000; Lux et al., 2000; Rubin et al., 2001; Choi et al., 2003). Activating mutations of plateletderived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRA) have recently been found in a subset of GISTs lacking KIT mutations (Heinrich et al., 2003). KIT and PDGFRA belong to the same subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinase III (Blume-Jensen and Hunter, 2001; Pawson, 2002), and the activating mutations of these two genes are mutually exclusive in GISTs. The mutations of these two genes can thus be regarded as alternative oncogenic mechanisms in GISTs. Although the mutually exclusive activating mutations of KIT and PDGFRA appear to contribute to the development of GIST through similar pathways, the specific downstream pathways, and their impact on the gene expression profile have not been evaluated. We therefore carried out a transcriptional gene expression study on 22 GISTs and compared the results with Received 15 June 2004; revised 16 September 2004; accepted 29 October 2004; published online 27 December 2004 *Correspondence: H Kim, Department of Pathology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 134 Sichon-dong, Seodaemun-gu, CPO Box 8044, Seoul 120-752, Korea; E-mail: hkyonsei@yumc.yonsei.ac.kr 8 These authors contributed equally to this work Oncogene (2005) 24, 1066–1074 & 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0950-9232/05 $30.00 www.nature.com/onc respect to the type of mutation status, KIT and PDGFRA. Results Clinicopathologic characteristics and mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA in GISTs Among the 22 GISTs, five cases were classified as benign (very low or low risk), 10 were classified as borderline (intermediate risk) and seven were classified as malignant (high risk). Immunoreactivity for KIT was present in 18. Immunoreactivity for CD34 and PDGFRA were found in 21 and 17 cases, respectively. 14q deletion was detected in 13 cases (Table 1). KIT mutation was detected in 17 out of 22 cases. In the 17 GISTs with KIT mutation, 16 mutations were present in exon 11 and one mutation was present in exon 9. Deletion mutations were most frequent, and these were found in seven cases, while point mutations were found in six cases and insertions were found in four cases. Among the remaining five cases lacking KIT mutations, three cases had PDGFRA mutation, all of them were being point mutations in exon 18. Unsupervised clustering analysis distinguish a subset of GISTs with lacking KIT mutation The relative expression of each gene was evaluated by comparing the degree of the expression to the Universal Human Reference RNA. Previous reports (Allander et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2002) have described homogeneous gene expression profiles in GISTs in contrast to the profiles of other types of mesenchymal tumors. In this study, we initially attempted a molecular pattern analysis to determine whether our spottedoligoarray system was able to identify different subsets of GISTs by molecular profiling. All of the oligoarray data of the samples described in this study are presented on our web page (http://www.molpathol.org/data/ GIST-arraydata.txt). With a relevant set of 4693 prefiltered genes (see ‘Materials and methods’), we conducted a complete-linkage hierarchical clustering analysis of 22 arrays. A two-way hierarchical clustering analysis did not completely distinguish GISTs with KIT mutation and those lacking KIT mutation. However, 13 out of 17 GISTs with KIT mutations formed a cluster separated by two small clusters. Moreover, among the five GISTs lacking KIT mutation, three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation and one GIST lacking both KIT and PDGFRA mutations formed a cluster (Supplementary Figure 1). Next, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) that allow classification of 22 samples with multiple components. The correlations between each component and the corresponding genetic and clinical characteristics were analysed for statistical significance. Component 1 was correlated significantly with the 14q deletion status (P ¼ 0.0005, Mann–Whitney rank-sum test, Table 2, Figure 1a), and component 5 was significantly correlated with the KIT and PDGFRA mutation status (P ¼ 0.01, Mann–Whitney rank-sum test, Table 2, Figure 1b). We then tried to identify a robust set of mutation type-related genes by a supervised rank-sum analysis using the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test. To identify the genes that were differentially regulated in GISTs according to the mutation status of KIT or PDGFRA, we selected 20 GISTs (17 GISTs with KIT mutation and three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation; two GISTs Table 1 Clinicopathological and genetic features of 22 GISTs Sample no.

In all, 70 genes were found to be either upregulated (seven genes) or downregulated (63 genes) in 17 GISTs with KIT mutation compared to the three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. The genes that were differentially expressed in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation are listed in Figure 2A and Supplementary Table 1. In order to examine the reliability of the microarray data, we selected KIT and two upregulated genes (IGFBP2 and PDGFRA) in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. The expressions of these genes were analysed by semiquantitative multiplex RT–PCR using the RNA samples used for the microarray analysis. The results of RT–PCR were consistent for all three genes (data not shown). Mutation of KIT and PDGFRA are directly correlated to the overexpression of active KIT and PDGFRA The effect of mutation on the activation of KIT and PDGFRA was examined at the RNA and protein levels (Figure 2A and B). The levels of KIT and PDGFRA protein and their phosphorylation status were analysed by Western blotting. KIT expression was increased in GISTs with KIT mutation (Figure 2B). The average relative expression ratio of KIT was 5.6 in 17 cases with KIT mutation and 0.1 in five GISTs lacking KIT mutation. In contrast, PDGFRA expression was found in GISTs regardless of PDGFRA mutation status: 14 out of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation expressed PDGFRA in addition to all three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. To determine whether KIT and PDGFRA expressions were related to their active forms, we examined their phosphorylation status. Out of 17 GISTs expressing KIT, 14 GISTs expressed phospho-KIT, whereas phospho-PDGFRA was detected in only four out of 17 GISTs expressing PDGFRA (Figure 2B). These results indicate that activation of KIT and PDGFRA was related to the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA, respectively, because 13 of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation expressed activated KIT and all three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation expressed activated PDGFRA. Immunohistochemically, KIT and PDGFRA were detected mainly in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. KIT expression was detected in 17 GISTs with KIT mutation and one of five GISTs lacking KIT mutation. The cytoplasmic PDGFRA expression was detected in all three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation, 13 of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation and one of two GISTs lacking both KIT and PDGFRA mutations (Table 1 and Figure 2c). Expression of activated STAT3, AKT and Erk1/2 in GISTs with KIT and PDGFRA mutation Since we found that the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA was directly related to the expression of activated KIT and PDGFRA, we evaluated the expression of the signaling molecules that are known to play key roles downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase III. We selected three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation (cases 1, 3 and 18) and five GISTs with KIT mutation (cases 5, 12, 15, 19 and 22), and we analysed STAT3 for the evaluation of JAK/STAT pathway, Erk1/2 of the MAPK pathway and AKT of the PI3 K pathway. As expected, all of the above molecules were expressed in their active forms in all of our GISTs; however, the level of their expression differed according to mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA. The expressions of phosphoSTAT3 and phospho-AKT were more intense in GISTs with KIT mutation than in those with PDGFRA mutation, while expression of phospho-Erk1/2 was stronger in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. There was no difference in the protein expression level of STAT3, AKT and Erk1/2 between our GISTs with KIT and PDGFRA mutation (Figure 3).

Components 1 correlated significantly with loss of chromosome 14q status, while component 5 and 9 correlated significantly with mutation status Gene expression profile of the GISTs HJ Kang et al 1068 Oncogene Discussion In this study, we have analysed the mutations of KIT and PDGFRA in our 22 GISTs, and compared the gene expression profiles according to the mutation status of these two genes. We found some differences in the gene expression profiles of GISTs according to the KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These findings suggest that GISTs may be classified at the molecular level according to the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA. Mutation of KIT has been implicated as a major genetic event in the tumorigenesis of GISTs, because most GISTs have shown gain-of-function mutation of KIT and germline mutation of KIT has been found in familial GISTs (Lasota et al., 1999; Taniguchi et al., 1999; Hirota et al., 2000; Lux et al., 2000; Maeyama et al., 2001). Recently, the mutation of PDGFRA has been considered as another causative genetic event (Heinrich et al., 2003; Hirota et al., 2003), as PDGFRA mutations were found in most of the GISTs lacking KIT Figure 1 Scatter plots of the output values in components 1 and 5. (a) One-dimensional scatter plot of component 1 shows that output values for GISTs with 14q deletion were significantly different from those without 14q deletion. (b) One-dimensonal scatter plot of component 5 shows that the output values for GISTs with KIT mutation were significantly different from the GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. (c) Three-dimensional scatter plot of values for component 1 (Y-axis), component 5 (Z-axis) and component 9 (X-axis). Red circles indicate GISTs with the loss of chromosome 14q, and blue circles indicate the GISTs without the loss of chromosome 14q. This plot demonstrates that subcategories of GISTs are present according to 14q deletion and PDGFRA mutation status. Three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation form a separate cluster on the plot (marked by an ellipse) Gene expression profile of the GISTs HJ Kang et al 1069 Oncogene mutation, and both PDGFRA and KIT belong to the same subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinase III (BlumeJensen and Hunter, 2001; Pawson, 2002). Thus, it has been speculated that the mutations of these two genes facilitate the transformation and progression of GISTs through the same pathway. We confirmed here that the mutations of KIT and PDGFRA are mutually exclusive in our GISTs. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that the mutations of KIT and PDGFRA correlated with their activation. The overexpression of KIT was found in 16 out of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation and one out of five GISTs lacking KIT mutation by Western blotting analysis. We have also demonstrated the presence of phosphorylated KIT in most GISTs with KIT mutation, and thus provided direct evidence for the role of KIT mutation in tumorigenesis. In contrast, the overexpression of PDGFRA was detected in most of GISTs regardless of PDGFRA mutation. PDGFRA was detected in 14 out of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation, in all three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation and in one out of two GISTs lacking both KIT and PDGFRA mutations. These findings are similar to a previous report where a subset of GISTs with KIT mutation expressed PDGFRA (West et al., 2004). In this study, we found Figure 2 Expression of KIT and PDGFRA at the RNA (A) and protein levels (B and C). (A) Supervised hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression patterns, and the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA of 20 GISTs. To detect differentially expressed genes in a given subclass, we ranked the genes using the Mann–Whitney rank-sum test. Outlier genes responsible for mutation status were selected by Po0.01. In addition, significant outlier subset genes were further narrowed by filtering genes showing greater than 72-fold expression changes in GISTs with KIT mutation compared to the average values from GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. Cases 1, 3 and 18 showed PDGFRA mutation (marked as blue), and the other 17 cases showed KIT mutation (marked red). (B) RNA expressions of KIT and PDGFRA were correlated to the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA (M, mutated type; W, wild type). In contrast, homogeneous CD34 expression was noted regardless of KIT or PDGFRA mutation. In all, 17 GISTs with KIT mutation showed an overexpression of KIT and activated KIT protein, while only one (case 3) of three GISTs (cases 1, 3 and 8) with PDGFRA mutation expressed KIT and showed activated KIT protein. PDGFRA was expressed in 14 of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation and all three GISTs with PDGFRA mutation; however, only one (case 5) out of 17 GISTs with KIT mutation and all three GISTs (cases 1, 3 and 18) with PDGFRA mutation demonstrated activated PDGFRA. (C) Example of histological (a and e), immunohistochemical analysis of KIT (b and f), PDGFRA (c and g) and CD34 (d and f). Overexpression of KIT and PDGFRA was directly correlated to the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA, respectively Gene expression profile of the GISTs HJ Kang et al 1070 Oncogene that the level of PDGFRA expression was higher in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation, in which activated PDGFRA was detected in only four out of 18 cases, and three of these exhibited the PDGFRA mutation. These findings indicate that the mutation of PDGFRA directly correlates with the activation of PDGFRA, and may be involved in the tumorigenesis of GISTs. KIT and PDGFRA are members of the receptor tyrosine kinase III family that are known to transduce their signals through the JAK/STAT pathway (Ihle and Kerr 1995; Schindler and Darnell, 1995; Weiler et al., 1996; Brizzi et al., 1999; Mui, 1999), Ras/ERK pathway (Porri and McCormick, 1996; Burack and Sturgill, 1997), PLC-g pathway (Zhang et al., 1996; Barker et al., 1998), PI3K pathway (Timokhina et al., 1998) and PDK and AKT (Schlessinger, 2000) pathways. All of these pathways have been suggested to contribute to tumor development, as they have been shown to regulate the cell cycle and cell differentiation through the activation of transcription factors (Miettinen et al., 2002). Our oligonucleotide microarray analysis allowed us to evaluate 15 genes (AKT, GRB, JAK, MAP2 K, MAPK, PDK, PI3 K, PIP3, RAF, RAS, SHC, SRC, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5) that are known to be involved in these signal transduction pathways. There were no remarkable differences in their RNA expression levels in our GISTs with KIT mutation and PDGFRA mutation. However, we did not find differences in the expression levels of activated proteins related to the JAK/STAT, PI3 K and MAPK signaling pathways between the GISTs with KIT mutation and those with PDGFRA mutation. The expressions of phospho-STAT3 and phospho-AKT were more intense in the GISTs with KIT mutation than in those with PDGFRA mutation, while expression of phospho-Erk1/2 was stronger in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. These findings suggest that there are some quantitative differences in the activation of the proteins downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase III between GISTs with KIT mutation and those with PDGFRA mutation, and that these differences may be associated with differential gene expression. GISTs show unique chromosomal, morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics. Recently, there have been two studies on the gene expression of GIST, and both have demonstrated that the gene expression profile of GISTs is different from those of the other types of mesenchymal tumors (Allander et al., 2001; Nielsen et al., 2002). Although these data indicated that GISTs are unique and homogeneous tumors, they show some diverse intertumoral variations at the clinical, morphological and genetic level. Clinically, GISTs are classified as benign, borderline or malignant tumors. Histopathologically, they exhibit two distinct forms, spindle and epithelioid, and mixed patterns are detected in some cases. In addition, several peculiar histologic patterns, such as alveolar pattern, have been detected in some GISTs. The genetic characteristics of GISTs are also diverse. The loss of the long arm of chromosome 14 was detected in 69 to 80% of GISTs (El-Rifai et al., 1998, 2000; Kim et al., 2000), and KIT mutation was found in 41 to 92% of GISTs (Lasota et al., 1999; Taniguchi et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2000; Lux et al., 2000; Rubin et al., 2001; Choi et al., 2003). In this study, we attempted to classify GIST at the molecular level according to the overall gene expression profiles. Our data suggest that GISTs may be categorized into subsets according to the mutation status of KIT and PDGFRA. The direct link between molecular classification and the activating mutations should be regarded as an important finding. Different gene expression patterns of the GISTs according to the anatomic tumor site and the different gene mutation status have recently been reported (Antonescu et al., 2004; Subramanian et al., 2004). When we correlated the molecular classification with the clinical, pathological and genetic characteristics by the PCA model, 14q deletion, KIT mutation and PDGFRA mutation had strong impacts. Furthermore, our data reveal that 70 genes are expressed differentially between the GISTs with the KIT and GISTs with the PDGFRA mutation. Most of these genes are overexpressed in GISTs with PDGFRA mutation. Some of these genes have known functions in signal transduction (ASB2, IGFBP2, IGFBP4, PDGFRA, RPS6KA1 and S100A1) and development (RELN and ANGPTL2). Further analysis in a larger series of cases and determination of the possible functional mechanism of these differentially expressed genes should clarify the molecular characteristics of KIT and PDGFRA mutation.

       "Linkage analysis and haplotype mapping in interspecific mouse crosses (Mus musculus times Mus spretus) identified the gene encoding Aurora2 (Stk6 in mouse and STK15 in human) as a candidate skin tumor susceptibility gene. The Stk6 allele inherited from the susceptible M. musculus parent was overexpressed in normal cells and preferentially amplified in tumor cells from F1 hybrid mice. We identified a common genetic variant in STK15 (resulting in the amino acid substitution F31I) that is preferentially amplified and associated with the degree of aneuploidy in human colon tumors. The Ile31 variant transforms rat1 cells more potently than the more common Phe31 variant. The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2N was a preferential binding partner of the 'weak' STK15 Phe31 variant form in yeast two-hybrid screens and in human cells. This interaction results in colocalization of UBE2N with STK15 at the centrosomes during mitosis. These results are consistent with an important role for the Ile31 variant of STK15 in human cancer susceptibility.    Studies of cancer predisposition have largely concentrated on the role of high penetrance susceptibility genes. Less than 10% of the total human tumor burden, however, is accounted for by mutations in these genes. More genetic variation in cancer risk is probably due to more common but less penetrant alleles1, 2. In man, such genes will be difficult to find as they do not segregate as single mendelian traits. The mouse offers a powerful system for studying polygenic traits, such as cancer, and has been widely used for this purpose3, 4, 5, 6. But problems at several levels must be overcome in any strategy to find tumor modifier genes: mapping the locus at high resolution, identifying the critical gene and finding the functional polymorphism. Standard linkage analysis methods for localizing quantitative trait loci (QTLs) detect loci within intervals of at least 10−30 cM, and the usual method of refining the region involves generation of congenic mice. This is an expensive and time-consuming process that can be problematic because multiple QTLs may colocalize within the same interval or because interacting genes must be present for the disease phenotype to be observed. Finally, identification of the relevant polymorphism is difficult because all of the genes in the immediate vicinity may have sequence variants that correlate with the phenotype7. We used a new multi-step approach that helps to resolve many of these problems by exploiting the genetic diversity between tumor-susceptible M. musculus and both outbred and inbred strains of tumor-resistant M. spretus with the high recombination and low linkage disequilibrium (LD) found in humans. Using this approach, we identified a common polymorphic variant in STK15 that modifies cell transformation in vitro and tumor aneuploidy in vivo and may be a low-penetrance tumor-susceptibility gene acting at the level of genetic instability.  RESULTS High resolution mapping of Skts13 We have previously identified by QTL analysis 12 loci that control skin tumor susceptibility in crosses between outbred M. spretus and inbred strains of M. musculus6, 8 (NSP cross). By further analysis of the same cross (in over 300 mice) using more densely spaced markers, we identified a new skin tumor susceptibility locus on distal chromosome 2, Skts13, that confers resistance to papilloma development (P = 3.4 times 10-3). We also carried out two independent backcrosses, each involving over 100 mice, between inbred strains of M. spretus (SPRET/Ei from the Jackson Laboratory and SEG/Pas from the Institute Pasteur) and the same strain of M. musculus (NIH/Ola). The cross with the SPRET/Ei mice (NSJ cross) showed an even stronger linkage with papilloma resistance at this locus (P = 3.7 times 10-5), whereas the SEG/Pas cross (NSE) showed no significant linkage (Fig. 1a). The fact that the results from the original outbred cross were intermediate between those from the two inbred crosses suggested that outbred mice segregate different alleles, whereas SPRET/Ei and SEG/Pas mice are homozygous with respect to resistance or susceptibility alleles, respectively.

Full FigureFull Figure and legend (7K)  Information on shared haplotypes in outbred populations of humans or experimental animals can be used to refine the locations of potential disease susceptibility genes. We therefore constructed haplotypes for distal chromosome 2 using the variation in microsatellite lengths between the M. spretus alleles in the outbred colony. Four different M. spretus haplotypes (H1 to H4) were present in these outbred mice (Table 1), and we investigated a possible association between haplotype and tumor number. We compared the mean papilloma numbers of the different haplotypes with that of mice from the same backcross that were homozygous NIH/Ola at this locus. Tumor number in mice with haplotypes H1, H2 and H3 but not with H4, each haplotype considered separately, differed significantly from that in mice that were homozygous NIH/Ola at this locus (all mice from the same cross; H1 P = 0.06, H2 P = 0.04, H3 P = 0.002, H4 P = 0.3). Therefore, we grouped haplotypes H1, H2 and H3 together. The mean papilloma number in mice with haplotypes H1, H2 and H3 combined (mean = 2.3, n = 107) also differed significantly from that in mice that were homozygous NIH/Ola at this locus (mean = 3.6, n = 113; P = 1.8 times 10-3).   Table 1. Haplotype of the distal part of chromosome 2 \\t Table 1 thumbnail\\t  Full TableFull Table  Notably, only two small intervals seemed to be shared by haplotypes H1, H2 and H3 but not by H4: D2Mit50 at 95.5 cM and a region from D2Mit172 to D2Jau1 at 98.5−100 cM. Including the haplotypes of the inbred M. spretus strains in this analysis and looking for an interval shared by haplotypes H1, H2 and H3 and SPRET/Ei (strong linkage in NSJ cross) but not by either H4 or SEG/Pas (no linkage in NSE cross), only part of the second region qualified, refining the locus to approximately 1 cM (with the causal polymorphism predicted to map between D2Mit229 and D2Jau1).  To determine the precise location of the lod score peak, we combined data from the NSJ backcross with data from NSP mice carrying haplotype H1, H2 or H3 and calculated the composite lod scores. The 1-cM region between D2Mit229 and D2Jau1 identified by haplotyping seemed to match the part of distal chromosome 2 with the highest lod score (6.1 at 99−100 cM; Fig. 1b). This coincidence of haplotyping and linkage analysis data strongly indicated the presence of a susceptibility/resistance allele within this interval. The most telomeric end of chromosome 2 was excluded in an independent study with mice that were generated by backcrossing for four generations to NIH/Ola. Papilloma numbers in mice homozygous with respect to NIH/Ola alleles on proximal chromosome 2 but heterozygous with respect to the most distal part (from D2Mit74 at 107 cM to the telomere) were similar to those in mice that were homozygous NIH/Ola for the entire length of chromosome 2 (J.P.d.K. and J.-H.M., unpublished results).  A physical map of Skts13 Skts13 lies in a region of distal mouse chromosome 2 that is orthologous to a locus on human chromosome 20q13.2 showing frequent amplification in a variety of tumor types including breast, colon and ovarian cancer9, 10, 11, 12. Increased 20q13.2 copy number is observed in approximately 18% of primary breast tumors and 40% of breast cancer cell lines and is associated with aggressive tumor behavior, poor prognosis, cellular immortalization and genomic instability. The amplicon on 20q13.2 consists of at least three smaller subamplicons, each containing a putative driver gene for amplification, ZNF217 (encoding a putative Kruppel-like transcription factor), CYP24A1 (encoding vitamin D 24 hydroxylase) and STK15 (encoding a centrosome-associated kinase; refs. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17).  To identify the genes located in the region of the mouse genome defined by haplotyping, we constructed a physical map of the distal part of chromosome 2 surrounding Stk6 using the Celera database (Fig. 2). The minimum amplicon on human 20q13.2 (refs. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) corresponds exactly to the 1-cM interval at 99−100 cM that we identified by haplotyping. These results indicate that the strategy we used identified a small interval whose human counterpart is amplified in tumors. Based on the location of the lod score peak (Fig. 1b) and the high frequency of 20q13.2 amplification in tumors, we decided to focus on the region at 99−100 cM, orthologous to the 20q13.2 amplicon. The possibility that the interval around D2Mit50 contains an additional susceptibility gene(s) has not yet been investigated.   Figure 2. Mouse and human physical maps surrounding Stk6/STK15. \\t Figure 2 thumbnail\\t Two scaffolds from the Celera database were used to construct the mouse map (upper). Arrows indicate the orientation of the genes. The human map (lower) was constructed with data from the Celera database and the Ensembl database of the human genome project. The intervals identified by haplotyping (in the mouse) and the subamplicons at the orthologous human locus are indicated. The physical map of the minimal region identified by mouse linkage analysis and haplotyping covers about 3.7 Mb. The commonly amplified region of human 20q13 covers about 3 Mb, although individual subamplicons are considerably smaller. UNK, unknown gene.    Full FigureFull Figure and legend (27K)  Stk6 is a candidate mouse tumor susceptibility gene We focused on the region containing Znf217, Cyp24a1 and Stk6 to look for polymorphisms that might influence protein function or expression. Preliminary gene expression analysis using a large panel of mouse skin tumor cell lines showed that although Znf217 and Stk6 were expressed at varying levels. Cyp24a1 was not detectably expressed at any stage of carcinogenesis (A.E.-T. and J.-H.M., unpublished results), and therefore this gene was not investigated further. To screen for important single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Znf217 and Stk6, we determined the coding sequences of these genes in NIH/Ola and SPRET/Ei mice. Polymorphisms in SPRET/Ei were considered potentially important if they were also present in haplotypes H1, H2 and H3 but absent in haplotype H4 and SEG/Pas mice. In Znf217, we identified 39 SNPs of which none fit the genetic screening criteria (A.E.-T. and J.P.d.K., unpublished results). In Stk6, we identified eight SNPs that all seemed to be silent (A.E.-T. and J.P.d.K., unpublished results). No obvious coding sequence changes in either of these genes could therefore be responsible for the linkage to tumor susceptibility in this region.  Next, we investigated possible differences in expression of Znf217 and Stk6 between NIH/Ola and SPRET/Ei mice. We determined allele-specific expression patterns of these genes in skin from normal (NIH/Ola times SPRET/Ei) F1 mice and from (NIH/Ola times SPRET/Ei) F1 mice treated with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) by RT−PCR and subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Although no differences in expression of Znf217 could be detected between M. musculus and M. spretus alleles, Stk6 was expressed at significantly higher levels from the M. musculus allele relative to the M. spretus allele (J.-H.M. and A.E.-T., unpublished results).  To confirm and quantify these results, we designed TaqMan probes specific for intra-exon polymorphisms that distinguish between M. musculus and M. spretus alleles of Stk6. Repeated TaqMan analyses of cDNA derived from RNA from normal and TPA-treated mouse skin showed a small but significant and reproducible difference in expression of approximately 0.8 CT in favor of the M. musculus Stk6 allele, independent of TPA treatment (Fig. 3a). As a control, similar experiments using genomic DNA from the same F1 hybrid mice showed a 1:1 ratio by TaqMan analysis (Fig. 3a). We then examined the expression patterns in several M. musculus/M. spretus hybrid cell lines derived from skin tumors. Expression of the M. musculus allele of Stk6 was 5−6 times higher than that of the M. spretus allele in F1 hybrid cell lines B9 and A5, and this overexpression was associated with a similar level of amplification of the gene (Fig. 3a). Of 19 cell lines that were available from F1 mice, 8 significantly overexpressed the M. musculus Stk6 allele (DeltaCT ranging from 1.9 to 15; Fig. 3b), and in 5 cases, overexpression was associated with specific amplification of the M. musculus allele (Fig. 3a,c). No cases were detected of amplification or overexpression of the M. spretus allele. This result is statistically highly significant (P = 0.0039) and lends strong support to the conclusions from the linkage data that a germline difference must exist between the M. spretus and M. musculus alleles of Stk6.   Figure 3. Allelic expression of Stk6. \\t Figure 3 thumbnail\\t (a) cDNA was prepared from normal skin of untreated (0) and TPA-treated (24 or 48 h) (NIH/Ola times SPRET/Ei) F1 mice and from skin tumor−derived M. musculus/M. spretus hybrid cell lines A5 and B9. The ratio between M. musculus and M. spretus Stk6 in these samples was determined by TaqMan analysis using allele-specific probes and is expressed as differences in CT levels (cycles), with positive DeltaCT values indicating overexpression of M. musculus Stk6 and negative DeltaCT values indicating overexpression of M. spretus Stk6. All cDNA samples including normal skin from F1 mice overexpressed the M. musculus allele of Stk6, independent of TPA treatment. For comparison, we also determined the M. musculus/M. spretus ratio in genomic DNA. As expected, this ratio is close to 1 (DeltaCT is approximately 0) in normal skin from F1 mice. The cell lines B9 and A5 showed clear amplification of the M. musculus Stk6 allele, probably causing the observed overexpression. Asterisks indicate significant differences between genomic DNA and cDNA samples. The means and standard deviations of three independent experiments are shown. (b) cDNA was prepared from other skin tumor−derived M. musculus/M. spretus hybrid cell lines. Six of these, derived from independent tumors, showed significant overexpression of the M. musculus allele, indicated by asterisks. (c) Genomic DNA was isolated from the same samples shown in b, and TaqMan analysis was carried out to measure gene copy number of Stk6. Four of the samples (denoted by asterisks) showed significant amplification of the M. musculus allele of Stk6.    Full FigureFull Figure and legend (20K)  In an attempt to find the causal polymorphism, we sequenced approximately 5,000 bp of the Stk6 upstream region containing the promoter from NIH/Ola, SPRET/Ei, one of the original outbred M. spretus mice and mice representing each of the haplotypes H1, H2 and H4. We did not identify any polymorphism that could explain the linkage and haplotype data. Identification of this polymorphism might require more extensive sequencing as control elements can be located at a considerable distance from the transcriptional start site or within introns or 3' regulatory regions; further studies are in progress to address this question. We can, however, conclude that there is an allele-specific difference in the regulation of Stk6 that is in agreement with a potential role as a tumor modifier gene. Further studies will be necessary to identify the causal polymorphism and to clarify the exact mechanism of transcriptional regulation.  Human candidate susceptibility genes on 20q13.2 Evidence for the presence of genetic variants that influence human tumor susceptibility is normally obtained from linkage analysis of large family pedigrees or alternatively by association studies using DNA samples from individuals with cancer and population-matched controls18. A susceptibility gene in the 20q13 region has been implicated in prostate cancer19, but no strong candidate gene has yet been identified. We initially carried out association studies using DNA samples from individuals of Northern European ancestry with cancer and matched controls using a series of polymorphisms that were identified in STK15, ZNF217 and CYP24A1. These studies suggested a role for only one SNP, a Tright arrowA change at position 91 in the STK15 coding sequence that alters the corresponding amino acid at position 31 from phenylalanine to isoleucine (Phe31Ile; A.E.-T., B.A.J.P., J.Chan, J. Ma and A.B., unpublished results). But the results in this population did not reach the significance levels required for acceptance as a true susceptibility variant20, and further analyses of additional samples are in progress and will be published elsewhere. Nevertheless, the mouse studies described above, together with suggestive data from association analysis and the functional evidence for a biochemical difference between the proteins encoded by the two alternative STK15 alleles (see below), prompted us to probe more deeply into the role of the variant STK15 forms in tumor development.  Gene amplification, tumor aneuploidy and STK15 Ile31 STK15 was originally identified as a frequently amplified gene in human colon cancers, but it is also amplified or overexpressed in other tumor types16, 17. Based on our observations that Stk6 is a strong candidate gene located in a mouse tumor susceptibility QTL and shows evidence of allele-specific changes in mouse tumors, we investigated the possibility that allele-specific amplification of the 91A allele of STK15 (encoding the Ile31 variant) might also occur in human tumors. We genotyped DNA samples from 162 individuals for whom both normal colon mucosa and colon tumor DNA was available. Of the 162 normal samples typed, 48 were heterozygous with respect to the 91Tright arrowA polymorphism, and we analyzed these 48 samples for allele-specific amplification of the 91Tright arrowA polymorphism of STK15 by TaqMan analysis (Fig. 4 and A.E.-T., unpublished results). Twenty-one samples showed no allelic imbalance between the two alleles, 4 samples showed gain of the 91T allele (encoding Phe31) and 19 samples showed gain of the 91A allele (encoding Ile31). Four samples showed differences of CTs of less than 0.6 and were scored as uncertain. These results show statistically significant allele-specific amplification of the 91A allele (P = 0.018, chi2 test), providing additional evidence for the role of this allele in human cancer.   Figure 4. Colon tumor amplification of STK15 alleles. \\t Figure 4 thumbnail\\t The ratio between the 91T and 91A alleles in heterozygous colon tumors was determined by TaqMan analysis using allele-specific probes and is expressed as differences in CT levels (cycles) with positive or negative DeltaCT values indicating amplification of the 91T or 91A allele, respectively. Of 48 samples typed, 4 showed amplification of the 91T allele greater than 0.6 CTs (samples in gray) and 19 showed amplification of the 91A allele (samples in white). Twenty-one samples showed no difference between normal and tumor DNA (one pair shown in black). Four samples showed amplification differences of less than 0.6 CTs and were scored as uncertain (not shown). The normalized means and standard deviations of three independent experiments are shown.    Full FigureFull Figure and legend (19K)  The possibility that the results are explained by another gene in LD with STK15 is highly unlikely, as LD in humans usually extends no more than 100 kb (ref. 21) and other candidate genes, such as ZNF217 and CYP24A1, are located much further away than 100 kb (Fig. 2). From LD analysis at the STK15 locus, we specifically showed that the SNPs identified in both ZNF217 and CYP24A1 are not in LD with the STK15 91Tright arrowA SNP (D' < 0.1). Even CSTF1, which is located very close to STK15 and shares potential regulatory sequences at the 5' end of both genes, did not have any common SNPs that are in LD with the STK15 91Tright arrowA SNP (A.E.-T., unpublished results). Statistically significant allele-specific amplification of the 91A allele is therefore strong evidence that the Ile31 variant is important in human cancer. The data highlight the potential usefulness of allele-specific copy number or expression changes in tumors as an alternative to linkage studies in both mouse and human systems for the detection of tumor susceptibility genes.  The main role of STK15 in tumor development is in controlling chromosome segregation during mitosis22, 23. Misregulation of this process results in aneuploidy, a distinctive feature of most cancers, which can be induced by overexpression of STK15 in cell lines16. We hypothesized that tumors from individuals carrying the 91A allele might show more evidence of aneuploidy than those from individuals who are homozygous with respect to the common 91T allele. Comparative genomic hybridization on microarrays (CGH arrays) is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene copy number changes in tumors14. We therefore carried out genome-wide CGH array analysis to investigate the degree of aneuploidy in tumors as a function of genotype.  We obtained high quality CGH profiles for 53 tumors (Fig. 5). Frequent gene copy number gains and losses occurred on multiple human chromosomes, in agreement with previous studies of genetic instability and aneuploidy in human colon cancers11, 24. Stratification of these results according to genotype at the STK15 91Tright arrowA SNP clearly showed that tumors from individuals carrying a single 91A allele (STK1591A/91T heterozygotes, Fig. 5c) were significantly more aneuploid than tumors from individuals with the genotype STK1591T/91T (Fig. 5b). Copy number gains on chromosomes 7p and 20p in tumors from STK1591A/91T individuals were highly significantly different from those in tumors from STK1591T/91T individuals (P < 0.01), and gains of other chromosome arms (1q, 2p, 2q, 3q, 8q and 15q) were significantly different (P < 0.05). Results on the group of tumors from individuals homozygous with respect to the high-risk 91A allele (STK1591A/91A) showed a similar trend but did not reach statistical significance because of the small number of individuals (n = 7) in this category (J.Y. and A.E.-T., unpublished results). Notably, in this particular data set, no significant correlation was observed between host STK15 genotype and gene copy number losses (J.Y. and A.E.-T., unpublished results), suggesting that STK15 genotype affects whole chromosome arm gains rather than loss of potential tumor suppressor genes by deletion.   Figure 5. CGH array analysis of colon cancer and STK15 genotype. \\t Figure 5 thumbnail\\t (a) Composite gains and losses on all autosomes are shown for 53 colon cancer samples. The y axis shows the percentage of tumors showing gains or losses on each chromosome arm. (b) Percentage of tumors from STK1591T/91T homozygous individuals showing gains of chromosome arms. (c) Percentage of tumors from STK1591A/91T heterozygous individuals showing gains of chromosome arms. The difference in frequency of gains on 20p and 7p with respect to tumors from STK1591T/91T individuals (b) are highly significant (**), and those on 1q, 2p, 2q, 3q, 8q and 15q are significant (*).    Full FigureFull Figure and legend (48K)  As an additional control, we grouped the individual CGH profiles according to genotype at the neighboring gene CSTF1. We examined a Gright arrowA polymorphism in the 3' untranslated region of CSTF1 because it is very close to the 91Tright arrowA SNP in STK15 and has a similar frequency (16% and 21%, respectively) in the population but is not in LD with this SNP. The highly significant changes on 7p and 20p that we observed between tumors from STK1591A/91T and STK1591T/91T individuals were not seen after stratification using the CSTF1 SNP (A.E.-T., unpublished results). With the exception of 8q, which showed a slight trend towards higher copy number in tumors from individuals homozygous with respect to the common allele of CSTF1, none of the chromosome arms showed any significant difference associated with CSTF1 genotype. We conclude that individuals with even one copy of the STK15 91A allele develop tumors that have on average a higher degree of aneuploidy than those from STK1591T/91T individuals.  STK15 Ile31 induces cell growth and tumorigenicity To test the functional significance of the 91Tright arrowA polymorphism in STK15, we carried out a series of cell growth assays using 293 cells and rat1 cells expressing either Phe31 or Ile31 isoforms of STK15. We selected stable transformants that showed equal levels of expression of the exogenous proteins (Fig. 6b) and tested them for growth in cell culture (Fig. 6a,c) or as xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 6d). In both 293 and rat1 cells, the high-risk STK15 Ile31 isoform induced more rapid cell growth than the low-risk STK15 Phe31 form. In addition, rat1 cells expressing the Ile31 isoform gave rise to actively growing tumors in nude mice by 28 d after injection, whereas controls expressing the Phe31 form produced only very small lesions. Thus, the STK15 Ile31 variant has more strongly transforming properties than the more common Phe31 variant.   Figure 6.

Full FigureFull Figure and legend (22K)  Interaction of STK15 Phe31 with UBE2N in vitro and in vivo STK15 has two functional domains, an N-terminal region containing the Aurora box, thought to mediate protein-protein interactions25, and the C-terminal catalytic domain. To identify any biochemical differences between the two isoforms of STK15, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen using as bait the sequences of amino acids 1−117 from each of the STK15 isoforms. One of these inserts contained UBE2N, the human homolog of yeast Ubc13, a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. We produced recombinant STK15 Phe31 and Ile31 isoforms tagged with histidine (His) and UBE2N for use in pull-down assays. We immobilized His-STK15 (1−117) on agarose beads and incubated it with recombinant in vitro translated UBE2N. UBE2N bound to the Phe31 isoform of STK15 (Fig. 7a). To confirm the UBE2N-STK15 interaction, we prepared cell lysates from 293 cells expressing the full-length STK15 Phe31 or Ile31 tagged with hemagglutinin (HA). These cells lines, constructed with the ecdysone inducible system, were induced with Ponasterone A resulting in lysates containing exogenous HA-tagged STK15. We immobilized His-UBE2N on His-agarose beads and incubated it with 1 mg of cell lysates. STK15 Phe31 bound to His-UBE2N to a greater extent than STK15 Ile31, although the lysates contained equal levels of STK15 protein (Fig. 7b).   Figure 7. In vitro and in vivo interaction between STK15 and UBE2N. \\t Figure 7 thumbnail\\t (a) His-tagged recombinant STK15 Phe31 or Ile31 (amino acids 1−117) was immobilized on agarose and incubated with in vitro−translated UBE2N.

(b) His-tagged recombinant UBE2N was immobilized on agarose and incubated with cell lysate containing 1 mg of total protein isolated from 293 inducible cells expressing HA-tagged STK15 Phe31 or Ile31. Total lysates were run to show equal levels of expression of STK15 Phe31 and Ile31.(c) HCT116 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged STK15 Phe31 or Ile31. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with UBE2N specific antibody and probed with antibody to Myc to detect the binding event of the exogenous STK15 isoforms.

(f) In cells expressing the STK15 Ile31, almost all of the UBE2N is cytoplasmic.    Full FigureFull Figure and legend (26K)  To address whether the interaction between UBE2N and STK15 Phe31 takes place under physiological conditions, we carried out a series of coimmunoprecipitation experiments. We chose the HCT116 colon cancer cell line (heterozygous with respect to the 91Tright arrowA polymorphism). We transiently transfected the HCT116 cells with both STK15 isoforms tagged with a Myc epitope and immunoprecipitated the endogenous UBE2N. STK15 Phe31 was also found in the precipitates (Fig. 7c). Apart from the expected STK15 band of 46 kDa, we also detected a high-molecular-weight smear that may represent ubiquitinated forms of STK15 (Fig. 7c). In agreement with this interpretation, we have shown in an in vitro assay that STK15 can be ubiquitinated in the presence of UBE2N, E1 ligase and ubiquitin (P.B. and S.L., unpublished results). Further studies are in progress to assess the effects of this modification on stability and activation state of STK15.  We carried out additional STK15 immunoprecipitations using two lymphoblastoid cell lines, 10859A (homozygous with respect to 91T) and 07038D (homozygous with respect to 91A), which were characterized genetically (A.E.-T., unpublished results), to investigate the binding levels of endogenous UBE2N. These cell lines provide an ideal environment to study the endogenous binding partners of the two STK15 isoforms, as each line is homozygous with respect to one of the STK15 alleles. As expected, UBE2N was detected at higher levels in immunoprecipitates from STK1591T/91T homozygous cells (Fig. 7d). Consistent with the data collected from the yeast two-hybrid and in vitro experiments, the Phe31 variant was required for the interaction; although STK15 Ile31 was expressed at a level similar to that of STK15 Phe31, it did not form a strong complex with UBE2N. We conclude that the interaction between UBE2N and STK15 Phe31 occurs with endogenous as well as with ectopically expressed proteins.  Ubc13, the yeast homolog of human UBE2N, has been reported to be mainly cytoplasmic in a complex with Mms2 but can translocate to the nucleus in response to DNA damage26. On the other hand, STK15 is located at the centrosomes and shows distinct cell cycle−regulated expression. To analyze possible colocalization of the two interacting proteins, we transfected the 293 inducible cell lines expressing the HA-tagged STK15 isoforms Phe31 or Ile31 with a Myc-tagged UBE2N construct. After double staining of the cells with the appropriate antibodies, we observed centrosome localization of STK15 Phe31 and UBE2N (Fig. 7e). STK15 Ile31 showed considerably less colocalization with UBE2N, and most cells expressing this isoform showed only the cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 7f), in agreement with earlier observations26. These data suggest that preferential binding of the Phe31 isoform to UBE2N results in selective concentration of the Phe31 protein in centrosomes, whereas UBE2N remains predominantly cytoplasmic in the presence of the Ile31 variant.  \\t Top    DISCUSSION Identifying the multiple combinations of common genetic variants that modify individual predisposition to sporadic cancers is widely considered the next challenge in determining the genetic basis of cancer susceptibility1, 2. The approach we describe uses the power of mouse genetics to map low-penetrance loci by linkage analysis and haplotyping. The use of outbred M. spretus in crosses with inbred M. musculus allowed us to carry out both analyses on the same experimental data set, obviating the necessity to refine the region containing the modifier locus by traditional methods, such as generation of congenic mice. Using this combined approach, we were able to refine the localization of a tumor susceptibility QTL to a region of 1−2 Mb on distal chromosome 2. Improving resolution further to the level of individual genes, however, required a parallel study of the orthologous locus in humans, to benefit from the high recombination history and low LD between individual human samples. Another important component of this analysis is the use of mouse and human tumor DNA samples to identify allele-specific genomic alterations, markers of the presence of germline variants that influence the course of tumor development. In several mouse tumor cell lines, increased expression of the M. musculus allele of Stk6 was associated with amplification of the allele, but this amplification event frequently involved fairly large regions of the chromosome, hampering identification of the gene(s) responsible for driving the process. In human tumors, the amplification event also frequently covered large regions, but the preferential amplification of the high risk STK1591A allele in tumors from unrelated heterozygotes provided strong evidence that this gene, rather than one of its near neighbors, is the main driving force for the amplification event. Even more convincingly, stratification of tumors according to genotype at the 91Tright arrowA SNP in STK15 indicated that individuals with even one 91A allele develop more highly aneuploid tumors, in agreement with the known role of STK15 in tumor progression.  This combined strategy allowed us to identify a common, low-penetrance tumor-susceptibility gene in both systems, although the mechanisms by which the genetic variants modify risk differ between mouse and human. In humans, a coding sequence polymorphism in STK15 does not alter the intrinsic kinase activity of the protein (P.B. and S.L., unpublished results) but modifies interactions with binding partners in the cell, such as UBE2N, that change its function. In mice, the Stk6 amino acid at the equivalent of position 31 in humans is the same as that encoded by the high-risk human allele, a notable observation in view of the known plasticity of the mouse genome and the ease with which mouse cells become aneuploid. The polymorphism responsible for the differential activity of Stk6 between the parental mouse strains used in these studies is unknown, but it seems to act at the level of transcription or mRNA stability, as differences were found in the expression patterns of the parental M. musculus and M. spretus alleles in normal cells and in tumors. The constitutive expression of what is effectively the high-risk human allele in normal mice suggests that mouse models will be important for testing drugs aimed at inhibition of STK15 activity for human cancer therapy. The recent development of BAC transgenic mice27 offers the possibility of testing the effect of expression of the variant human STK15 alleles on tumor development in the mouse.  STK15 is a member of the Aurora/Ipl1p family of mitotically regulated serine/threonine kinases that are key regulators of chromosome segregation and cytokinesis22. A wealth of functional data exists showing that overexpression of STK15 leads to centrosome amplification, chromosomal instability and transformation15, 16, 17, 28. Immunohistochemical analyses showed overexpression of STK15 in 94% of invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the breast, which is notable because genetic instability is an early event in the development of ductal breast carcinoma29. All these findings support our hypothesis that elevated expression of STK15 modifies cancer risk, perhaps by leading to aneuploidy. During mouse skin carcinogenesis, initiation by mutation of the gene Hras1 is followed by trisomy of chromosomes 7 and 6 (refs. 30,31), an event that could be facilitated by increased expression of Stk6.  The consequences of overexpressing the two allelic variants in cell lines support the identification of the STK15 91A allele as a high-risk allele: both cell growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice are enhanced by this variant but less so by the alternative 91T variant. We also show that the weak Phe31 variant preferentially binds to UBE2N in human cells and is colocalized with UBE2N in the centrosomes. UBE2N belongs to a family of ubiquitin-conjugating E2 enzymes, with over 17 members characterized to date. E2 ligases have not been reported, apart from a few exceptions including Ubc2 (Rad6) and Ubc9, to bind to the ubiquitin substrate directly32. The direct binding between UBE2N and STK15 could suggest that the kinase is a direct substrate for ubiquitination by UBE2N, and further studies are in progress to address this question, as well as to identify other components of the UBE2N- STK15 complex. The outcome of this interaction, which may lead either to activation of STK15 (and subsequent cell death) or to inactivation and degradation, is also unclear. Nevertheless, this interaction correlates with attenuation of the ability of STK15 to induce cell growth and transformation. The mechanisms of cell transformation by this mitotic kinase are clearly complex and may involve kinase substrates that lie outside the centrosome, as shown by the observation that kinase-defective mutants of STK15 can induce centrosome amplification but not transformation33. Further elucidation of the UBE2N-STK15 complex might identify a pathway that regulates the essential functions of STK15 activity in cell cycle progression, providing additional targets for the development of new cancer therapies.  Our preliminary analyses of the importance of the STK15 91Tright arrowA polymorphism in human cancer susceptibility by association studies in cancer cases and controls provided some suggestive evidence of greater risk in homozygotes but not in heterozygous individuals (A.E.-T., B.A.J.P., J. Chan, J. Ma and A.B., unpublished results). To reach formal statistical significance for an allele with a 6% homozygote frequency and low relative risk, several thousand cases and controls would be required. The cross-species strategy described here based on the mapping of loci in mouse models and allele-specific alterations in tumors, may lead more rapidly to the identification of candidate human low-penetrance susceptibility genes. The gene PTPRJ was also recently identified as a potential mouse and human tumor-susceptibility gene, based on combined data from mouse models and human tumor analysis34. The use of appropriate mouse models to guide the prioritization of candidate low-penetrance susceptibility loci for testing in human association studies could lead to significant advances in understanding the polygenic basis of cancer.  The mitotic kinase Aurora A (Aur-A) is required for formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle and accurate chromosome segregation. In somatic cells, Aur-A protein and kinase activity levels peak during mitosis, and Aur-A is degraded during mitotic exit. Here, we investigated how Aur-A protein and kinase activity levels are regulated, taking advantage of the rapid synchronous cell division cycles of Xenopus eggs and cell-free systems derived from them. Aur-A kinase activity oscillates in the early embryonic cell cycles, just as in somatic cells, but Aur-A protein levels are constant, indicating that regulated activation and inactivation, instead of periodic proteolysis, is the dominant mode of Aur-A regulation in these cell cycles. Cdh1, the APC/C activator that targets many mitotic proteins for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis during late mitosis and G1 in somatic cells, is missing in Xenopus eggs and early embryos. We find that addition of Cdh1 to egg extracts undergoing M phase exit is sufficient to induce rapid degradation of Aur-A. Aur-A contains both of the two known APC/C recognition signals, (1) a C-terminal D box similar to those required for ubiquitin-dependent destruction of cyclin B and several other mitotic proteins, and (2) an N-terminal KEN box similar to that found on cdc20, which is ubiquitinated in response to APC/CCdh1. The D box is required for Cdh1-induced destruction of Aur-A but the KEN box is not. Destruction also requires a short region in the N terminus, which contains a newly identified recognition signal, the A box. The A box is conserved in vertebrate Aur-As and contains serine 53, which is phosphorylated during M phase. Mutation of serine 53 to aspartic acid, which can mimic the effect of phosphorylation, completely blocks Cdh1-dependent destruction of Aur-A. These results suggest that dephosphorylation of serine 53 during mitotic exit could control the timing of Aur-A destruction, allowing recognition of both the A box and D box by Cdh1-activated APC/C.  Keywords: Mitosis, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), proteolysis, Xenopus eggs, D box, A box The serine/threonine kinase Aurora A (Aur-A) is required for progression through mitosis, and overexpression of Aur-A generates aneuploidy (for review, see Bischoff and Plowman 1999; Goepfert and Brinkley 2000; Nigg 2001). Aur-A was first identified as a Drosophila mutant in which centrosomes fail to separate and cells arrest in mitosis with chromosomes arranged on circular monopolar mitotic spindles (Glover et al. 1995). In C. elegans embryos lacking Aur-A, centrosomes separate normally but then collapse and fail to assemble a bipolar spindle (Schumacher et al. 1998; Hannak et al. 2001). Thus, Aur-A is required for formation of a functional bipolar spindle and the completion of mitosis. In somatic cells, Aur-A mRNA, protein, and kinase activity levels are low during G1 and S phase, rise during G2 and mitosis, and drop during mitotic exit into G1 of the next cell cycle (Gopalan et al. 1997; Kimura et al. 1997; Bischoff et al. 1998; Farruggio et al. 1999; Honda et al. 2000; Walter et al. 2000; Crosio et al. 2002). During G2 and early prophase, Aur-A protein concentrates around centrosomes and, as mitosis progresses, is also found on spindle microtubules near the poles; Aur-A relocalizes to centrosomes during telophase and is destroyed late during mitotic exit (Gopalan et al. 1997; Kimura et al. 1997; Roghi et al. 1998; Bischoff and Plowman 1999; Giet et al. 1999; Honda et al. 2000; Crosio et al. 2002; Meraldi et al. 2002). It seems likely that localization at the spindle poles, which is mediated by the N-terminal noncatalytic domain (Giet and Prigent 2001), is essential for Aur-A's function during mitosis.  Overexpression of Aur-A results in cells that contain multiple centrosomes and multipolar spindles, and these cells quickly become aneuploid (Zhou et al. 1998; Meraldi et al. 2002). In humans, the Aur-A containing locus 20q13 is amplified in many breast and colorectal cancers (Sen et al. 1997; Bischoff et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 1998). Forced overexpression of either human or Xenopus Aur-A transforms NIH3T3 cells and promotes tumor formation in nude mice; kinase-dead forms do not (Bischoff et al. 1998; T. Andresson, L. Amundedottir, P. Leder, and J. Ruderman, in prep.). Mutations leading to defects in the timing or extent of Aur-A destruction would also lead to overexpression of Aur-A, and therefore would also be expected to be deleterious.  All Aur-A family members contain two different sequences known to be required for the destruction of other mitotic proteins: the D box and the KEN box (Glotzer et al. 1991; King et al. 1996; Pfleger et al. 2001). These sequences target specific mitotic proteins for ubiquitination by the APC/C (anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome) and subsequent proteolysis by the proteasome (for review, see Townsley and Ruderman 1998; Zachariae 1999; Tyers and Jorgensen 2000). Two major forms of the APC/C function during mitotic exit. Cdc20-activated APC/C recognizes D box-containing proteins such as cyclin B and securin, initiating their ubiquitination during the metaphase/anaphase transition. The destruction of cyclin B is followed by inactivation of cdc2 and dephosphorylation of cdc2 targets, including the APC/C activator Cdh1. Dephosphorylated Cdh1 then binds the APC/C, programming it to ubiquitinate KEN box-containing proteins including Cdc20 and a small number of other known targets. Cdh1-activated APC/C then maintains the ubiquitination-dependent destruction of several KEN box and D box-containing proteins during the completion of mitotic exit and G1 (Kramer et al. 2000; Petersen et al. 2000; Sudo et al. 2001).  Aur-A is unusual in that it contains both KEN-like and D box-like sequences and, in fact, has three potential D boxes. Previous investigations had reported variously that removal of the N-terminal KEN sequence did not block destruction (Arlot-Bonnemains et al. 2001), that none of the D box sequences were required for the in vitro ubiquitination of Aur-A (Honda et al. 2000), that mutation of the C-terminal D box completely stabilized Aur A (Castro et al. 2002), and that removal of the C-terminal D box partially stabilized and removal of second D box completely blocked destruction (Arlot-Bonnemains et al. 2001).  We find that in eggs, as in somatic cells, Aur-A kinase activity is high in M phase and low in interphase. In striking contrast, however, Aur-A protein levels remain constant across the first several embryonic cell divisions, indicating that kinase activation and inactivation is the sole mode of regulating Aur-A activity in these cell cycles. The complete stability of Aur-A after fertilization is perfectly reproduced in egg extracts undergoing mitotic exit and progression through the first cell cycle in vitro. Addition of the APC/C activator Cdh1, which is absent from eggs and appears only much later in development (Lorca et al. 1998; Kramer et al. 2000), leads to the rapid and complete destruction of Aur-A, whereas addition of Cdc20 does not. Mutation of the C-terminal D box completely stabilized Aur-A against Cdh1-dependent destruction whereas mutation of the N-terminal K6EN box did not. Additional deletions revealed the existence of an N-terminal sequence (residues 34–68) that is absolutely required for Cdh1-dependent destruction of Aur-A and can direct the degradation of the N terminus in the absence of any conventional D box. This region includes a short sequence that is highly conserved in vertebrate Aur-As and contains serine 53, a site of mitotic phosphorylation (L. Littlepage, H. Wu, J. Deanehan, and J. Ruderman, in prep.). We refer to this region as the A box. Mutation of serine 53 to aspartic acid completely blocks destruction, suggesting that dephosphorylation of ser53 during mitotic exit is a prerequisite for Aur-A degradation.  Go to: Results Aur-A kinase activity oscillates after fertilization, but Aur-A protein levels remain constant  To monitor Aur-A levels and kinase activity, we generated and affinity-purified antibodies against the N-terminal noncatalytic domain (1–146) of Xenopus Aur-A. This antibody is highly specific: It recognizes a single band of the correct size on blots of whole cell extracts, and shows no reactivity with bands of the sizes of Aur-B or Aur-C (Figs. (Figs.11 and and3A,3A, below). It recognizes a single band in reticulocyte translation product programmed by Aur-A mRNA and immunoprecipitates more than 80% of Aur-A protein from egg lysates (see Supplemental Fig. 1 in Supplementary Material at http://www.genesdev.org).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Aur-A protein levels in Xenopus somatic tissue culture cells. XTC cells analyzed were synchronized as described in Materials and Methods. Fifty micrograms of protein was loaded per lane, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted with anti-cyclin B1, anti-cdc2 ... Figure 3 Figure 3 Aur-A protein levels are constant following fertilization or electrical activation of eggs. (A) Fertilization. Eggs were fertilized, and samples were taken at 10-min intervals. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the indicated ... As in mammalian somatic cells, the amount of Aur-A protein peaks during mitosis (Fig. (Fig.1).1). To identify the pathways that regulate the periodic accumulation, activation, and destruction of Aur-A, we chose to exploit the simplified cell cycles of Xenopus eggs, where it is possible to obtain large amounts of cells that proceed through mitosis synchronously, and concentrated cytoplasmic extracts derived from these cells that faithfully reproduce many events of cell cycle progression in vitro. To determine whether Aur-A kinase activity oscillates across the first embryonic cell cycles, metaphase II-arrested eggs were fertilized and samples were taken at 10-min intervals. Aur-A was immunoprecipitated from each sample and assayed for in vitro kinase activity towards myelin basic protein. As shown in Figure Figure2,2, Aur-A kinase activity was high in eggs, dropped after fertilization, remained low during interphase, rose during mitosis 1 and dropped again at the end of mitosis 1.  Figure 2 Figure 2 Aur-A kinase activity oscillates during the early embryonic cell cycle. Eggs were fertilized and collected at 10-min intervals following fertilization. Using the equivalent of five eggs, Aur-A was immunoprecipitated with affinity-purified Aur-A antibody ... Surprisingly, immunoblots revealed that Aur-A protein levels were constant across the first three cycles (Fig. (Fig.3A).3A). Several synchrony and loading controls established that this result was not due to poor synchrony or uneven loading. Cyclin B showed its characteristic destruction, resynthesis, and loss during the first cycle, Mos was degraded on schedule and failed to reappear during subsequent cycles, and cdc2 remained constant, all as expected (Watanabe et al. 1991). Identical results were obtained in numerous independent experiments.  The finding that Aur-A protein levels remained constant across the first three cell cycles differed from a previous report that Aur-A protein is degraded within 30 min of electrical activation, a treatment that mimics most events initiated by fertilization (Frank-Vaillant et al. 2000). In view of Aur-A's localization at centrosomes, its role in spindle function, and the fact that the sperm provides the centrioles that organize the first mitotic spindle (Shaver 1953; Maller et al. 1976; Masui et al. 1978), it seemed possible that the different fates of Aur-A following fertilization versus activation could be a spindle- or centrosome-dependent difference in the way Aur-A degradation is regulated. Since the postactivation disappearance of Aur-A had been obtained using a Xenopus Aur-A monoclonal antibody (Roghi et al. 1998), it seemed possible that the disappearance of the Aur-A signal on blots might reflect epitope masking during exit from the metaphase II arrest. However, as shown in Figure Figure3B,3B, neither of these possibilities proved to be the explanation. Following electrical activation of eggs, Aur-A protein levels on immunoblots appeared constant when probed with either our affinity-purified polyclonal antibody or the monoclonal antibody. In addition, as shown in Figure Figure4,4, Aur-A protein levels remained constant even when ongoing protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide. Thus, we conclude that Aur-A protein does not undergo significant degradation, either following fertilization or parthenogenetic activation, and that Aur-A protein levels remain constant across the first few cleavage division cycles. Taken together, these results also reveal that posttranslational regulation of Aur-A's kinase activity provides the major mode of regulating its function during the embryonic cell cycles.  Figure 4 Figure 4 The addition of Cdh1 induces destruction of Aur-A during mitotic exit. Recombinant Cdh1 or Cdc20 protein was added to CSF-arrested extracts, and calcium was added to induce M-phase exit. Samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, and 180 min after calcium addition ... Aur-A is stable in extracts of activated eggs and degraded upon addition of the APC/C activator Cdh1  The regulated proteolysis of several proteins during mitotic exit is dependent on the presence of one of two known recognition signals, the KEN box and the D box. Aur-A contains sequences resembling both types of destruction motifs. Cdc20 is present in eggs and early embryos, but Cdh1 protein is undetectable and appears only much later in development (Lorca et al. 1998; Kramer et al. 2000; S. Rankin and M. Kirschner, pers. comm.). Because (1) Aur-A contains a KEN sequence similar to those required for Cdh1-dependent destruction of other proteins, (2) Cdh1 is not present in the early cell cycles, and (3) Aur-A is stable in the early cell cycles, we reasoned that the stability of Aur-A might be due to the absence of Cdh1. Prompted by the finding that addition of recombinant Cdh1 protein to Xenopus egg interphase extracts can induce destruction of Cdc20 and two other KEN-box proteins (Pfleger and Kirschner 2000), we investigated whether addition of Cdh1 would trigger destruction of Aur-A during M phase exit in eggs. Extracts were prepared from metaphase II-arrested eggs (CSF extracts), cycloheximide was added to block further protein synthesis, calcium was added to induce M phase exit, and the fate of endogenous Aur-A protein was followed on immunoblots. As expected (Glotzer et al. 1991; Funabiki and Murray 2000), cyclin B and another D box protein, the chromokinesin Xkid, were rapidly degraded, whereas cdc2 remained stable (Fig. (Fig.4,4, left panels). Addition of recombinant Cdh1 protein induced complete destruction of endogenous Aur-A (top panel), whereas addition of Cdc20 did not. This result strongly suggests that (1) Aur-A is targeted for destruction by Cdh1-activated APC/C, and (2) the lack of Cdh1 accounts for the lack of Aur-A degradation during the early embryonic cell cycles. Consistent with this idea is the recent report that recombinant Aur-A is degraded in lysates of G1-stage Xenopus somatic tissue culture cells, which are presumed to contain Cdh1 (Arlot-Bonnemains et al. 2001).  Mutation or deletion of the R378 D box stabilizes Aur-A during mitotic exit  In recent work, Prigent and colleagues investigated regions required for destruction of Aur-A in somatic cells during G1 phase (Arlot-Bonnemains et al. 2001). They found that mutation or removal of the most highly conserved D box sequence, R378xxLxxVxE, blocked the disappearance of Aur-A in lysates of G1 cells, whereas deletion of the sequence K6EN did not. To determine whether the D box or KEN box is required for Cdh1-dependent destruction during mitotic exit in eggs, we used the following approach. Extracts were prepared from metaphase II-arrested eggs, radiolabeled translation product encoded by wild-type or mutant Aur-A was added in the presence or absence of Cdh1 or Cdc20, and calcium was then added to induce mitotic exit. As shown in Figure Figure5A,5A, wild-type Aur-A translation product showed the same pattern of Cdh1-dependent destruction seen for endogenous Aur-A: it was stable during mitotic exit and rapidly degraded in the presence of Cdh1. Truncations that remove the C-terminal D box R378xxLxxVxE stabilized Aur-A in this assay. A single point mutation in the D box, Arg378Ala, also blocked the Cdh1-dependent destruction of Aur-A during mitotic exit (Fig. (Fig.5B).5B).  Figure 5 Figure 5 The C-terminal D box and the N-terminal region (34–68), that is, the A box, are required for Cdh1-dependent destruction of Aur-A, but the KEN box is not. CSF extracts containing cycloheximide were incubated with Cdh1 or Cdc20, as indicated, and ... From these results, we conclude that (1) the R378 D box is required for destruction during both mitotic exit (Fig. (Fig.5)5) and G1 (Arlot-Bonnemains et al. 2001), (2) the R378 D box functions as a Cdh1 recognition site, and (3) when the R378 D box is removed, the two other less conserved D box-like sequences do not function as alternative degradation signals. Because Aur-A is stable in the early cycles, when endogenous Cdc20 is active, and remains stable even when excess Cdc20 is added, we can further conclude that (4) the R378 D box functions as a Cdh1-specific recognition signal.  Identification of the A box, a novel APC/C recognition signal  Mutation (Fig. (Fig.5C)5C) or deletion (data not shown) of the KEN box did not block Cdh1-dependent destruction during mitotic exit in eggs. Although the KEN box itself is not required for Aur-A destruction, either during mitotic exit or G1, analysis of further truncations revealed the existence of a short region within the N terminus which is essential for Cdh1-dependent destruction (Fig. (Fig.5C).5C). Removal of the first 33 residues slightly delayed but did not block destruction. In contrast, removal of the first 68 residues completely stabilized Aur-A against Cdh1-induced destruction. Thus, the region 34–68 contains a novel APC/CCdh1 recognition signal.  This region (Fig. (Fig.6)6) contains a short sequence, Q47RILGPSNVPQRV, which is highly conserved in vertebrate Aur-As. This region also includes serine 53, a residue that is phosphorylated during mitosis (see Materials and Methods). Because this sequence is found in all vertebrate Aur-As, but not in Aur-B or C, we refer to this region as the A box. Mutation of ser53 to alanine did not block destruction, but mutation to aspartic acid (a residue that can often mimic a phosphorylated ser or thr residue) completely blocked Cdh1-induced destruction (Fig. (Fig.5C).5C). This result strongly suggests that mitotic phosphorylation of Aur-A at ser53 blocks destruction and that Cdh1-dependent destruction during mitotic exit requires dephosphorylation of serine 53. As such, this would represent the first example where recognition of a target by the APC/C is regulated by the phosphorylation status of the target protein.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Sequence of the conserved Aur-A A box region, which is required for Cdh1-dependent destruction. Residues conserved between Aur-A and Aur-B in this region are highlighted. Serine 53 is indicated in bold. Surprisingly, the entire N-terminal noncatalytic domain, residues 1–136, by itself was degraded following Cdh1 addition (Fig. (Fig.5D).5D). A hybrid protein consisting of the entire N terminus human Aur-A fused to GFP was also degraded (R. Crane and L. Littlepage, unpubl.), indicating that this region contains a portable destruction domain. Mutating K6EN to AAA did not interfere with destruction of the N-terminal fragment, further confirming that the conserved KEN sequence is not required. In contrast, mutating ser53 to asp completely blocked Cdh1-induced destruction of the N-terminal fragment (Fig. (Fig.5C).5C). These findings suggest that the A-box serves as the primary site regulating Aur-A destruction. The ability of the N-terminal domain by itself to undergo Cdh1-induced destruction suggests an ordered pathway for Aur-A destruction, in which dephosphorylation of Aur-A late in mitosis is followed by D box-dependent APC/CCdh1-mediated ubiquitination of the C terminus, which then permits recognition of the A box, followed by full ubiquitination and destruction of Aur-A (see Discussion).  The effects of expressing nondegradable Aur-A mutants in somatic cells are similar to those seen with wild-type or inactive Aur-A  The vast majority of maternal Aur-A protein remains stable during the early cell cycles, clearly indicating that these cycles proceed in the presence of high Aur-A protein levels. Therefore, we turned to mammalian somatic cells to investigate whether the introduction of nondegradable Aur-A would affect cell cycle progression and if the two different types of nondegradable mutants would have similar or different effects.  Xenopus wild-type and mutant constructs were subcloned into the retroviral vector pMSCV-IRES-GFP, which expresses the inserts at low levels. This vector was chosen in hopes of being able to reduce effects due simply to overexpression. NIH3T3 cells were infected with constructs encoding wild-type Aur-A, a kinase-dead mutant (K169R), Aur-A lacking the N-terminal 118 residues, or Aur-A containing the single D box point mutation, R378A. Several independently derived stable cell lines were isolated for each construct. Although the tagged Aur-A proteins were expressed at levels too low to be reliably detectable on immunoblots, expression was readily confirmed by RT-PCR (see Supplemental Fig. 2 in Supplementary Material at http://www.genesdev.org).  Cells were stained with γ-tubulin antibodies to monitor centrosomes and with Hoechst to reveal nuclei. GFP-positive cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Cells carrying wild-type Aur-A showed a modest decrease in cells with the normal number of centrosomes per cell (one or two) and a corresponding increase in cells containing three or more centrosomes (Fig. (Fig.7A),7A), in agreement with previous work (Zhou et al. 1998; Meraldi et al. 2002). Many of those cells contained numerous centrosomes (Fig. (Fig.8).8). Surprisingly, the same was true of cells expressing the Aur-A K169R mutant, which has no detectable kinase activity (Andresson and Ruderman 1998). This result indicates that the kinase activity of the ectopically expressed Aur-A is not required for its ability to generate cells with abnormally high numbers of centrosomes. Cell lines stably infected with wild-type or kinase-dead Aur-A showed a substantial increase in the number of binucleate cells with 4C or greater DNA content, and almost all of those cells had multiple centrosomes (Figs. (Figs.7B7B and and8;8; data not shown). A similar study was reported very recently by Meraldi et al. 2002), where wild-type and kinase-dead Aur-A were expressed using transient transfection. By monitoring the effects shortly after transfection, those authors concluded that centrosome amplification and aneuploidy were not, as commonly assumed, the results of increased centrosome duplication during S phase but were instead the consequence of defects in mitotic exit and cytokinesis. These results indicate that the major way in which Aur-A overexpression interferes with mitotic exit is not by sustained phosphorylation of substrates but instead through noncatalytic interactions with other proteins.  Figure 7 Figure 7 Expression of wild-type, kinase-dead, and nondegradable Aur-A mutants in NIH3T3 cells all result in an increase in cells containing multiple centrosomes and greater than 2N amounts of DNA. NIH3T3 cells were infected with retroviruses expressing vector ... Figure 8 Figure 8 Expression of wild-type, kinase-dead, and nondegradable Aur-A mutants in NIH3T3 cells all result in centrosome amplification and multinucleation. NIH3T3 cells stably infected with retroviruses expressing vector alone (A,B), wild-type Aur-A (C,D), K169R ... To test the effects of nondegradable versions of Aur-A and to ask whether these effects would be similar or different depending on the type of stabilizing mutation, we examined cell lines carrying Aur-A lacking the N terminus (Δ1–118) or mutated in the D box (R378A). Expression of either mutant led to roughly the same fraction of cells expressing the same defects seen with wild-type and kinase-dead Aur-A. Both led to an increase in cells with more than two centrosomes and 4C or greater DNA content (Fig. (Fig.7),7), and in many cases, cells with large numbers of centrosomes (Fig. (Fig.8).8). Thus, both nondegradable mutants had easily detectable effects, indistinguishable from those obtained with wild-type or kinase-dead Aur-A. This result, which was somewhat unexpected, suggests that in somatic cells, even modest increases in Aur-A are sufficient to quickly generate aneuploidy.  Go to: Discussion The work presented here establishes four main points. First, in contrast to its periodic synthesis and destruction in the somatic cell cycles, Aur-A is maintained at constant levels during the early embryonic cell cycles, and oscillations in its kinase activity are regulated solely at the posttranslational level. Second, this stability appears to be due to the lack of the APC/C activator Cdh1, addition of which induces rapid destruction during mitotic exit. Mutation of the C-terminal D box blocks Cdh1-induced destruction, but mutation of the N-terminal KEN box does not. Third, in addition to the D box, destruction requires a newly identified APC/C recognition signal, the A box, which is located within the N-terminal noncatalytic domain. Fourth, the A-box contains a conserved residue, serine 53, a site of mitotic phosphorylation. Mutation of serine 53 to alanine does not block Cdh1-induced destruction of Aur-A but mutation to aspartic acid does, suggesting that phosphorylation might negatively regulate Aur-A destruction until the last stages of mitotic exit. The sequence surrounding serine 53 does not resemble any known kinase consensus sequence, raising obvious questions about the identity of the Aur-A serine 53 kinase and how phosphorylation at this site is regulated.  Earlier work had reported that Aur-A was degraded during mitotic exit in eggs (Frank-Vaillant et al. 2000). We find, however, that Aur-A levels are constant following fertilization and during the early embryonic cell cycles and that its stability can be attributed to a lack of endogenous Cdh1 protein in eggs and early embryos. This finding agrees with those of Castro et al. (2002), which appeared after the completion of our work. In retrospect, the stability of Aur-A protein in eggs and early embryonic cycles is not surprising in view of the fact that Aur-A mRNA is deadenylated and ceases translation following fertilization (Paris et al. 1991; for review, see Wickens et al. 2000).  Despite the presence of three D box-like sequences, in Aur-A, a single point mutation in the R378 D box is sufficient to completely block Cdh1-induced destruction during mitotic exit in eggs, in agreement with the recent results of Castro et al. (2002). In contrast, in studies where the stability of Aur-A was followed in lysates of G1 cells, mutations in both the R378 D box and a second D box were required to fully stabilize Aur-A (Arlot-Bonnemains et al. 2001). One possible explanation of this difference is that the R378 D box is the only one used during mitotic exit, as in early embryos which lack G1 phases, whereas both D boxes are required to maintain destruction during G1, an idea that is currently being tested.  Full-length Aur-A requires both an A box and a D box for its Cdh1-dependent destruction. Other examples are known of proteins, such as cdc6, the kinase Hsl1p, and some cyclin A proteins, whose APC/C-mediated destruction requires two signals (the KEN box and the D box for complete destruction; Petersen et al. 2000; Burton and Solomon 2001). In those cases, however, mutation in either sequence alone only partially stabilized those proteins (Petersen et al. 2000; Jacobs et al. 2001; Kaspar et al. 2001). Aur-A is different in that mutation of either the A box or the D box completely stabilized the protein. Taken together, these results may have indicated that efficient recognition and ubiquitination of Aur-A strictly requires both the A box and the D box. However, the N-terminal noncatalytic domain by itself, which contains the A box, is rapidly and completely degraded in response to Cdh1. This result suggests that a multistep pathway of regulated Aur-A ubiquitination may exist. One possibility is that recognition of both the A box and D box is blocked during mitosis by phosphorylation of serine 53. Dephosphorylation of serine 53 during mitotic exit could result in a conformational change that makes the D box accessible to binding and ubiquitination by the APC/C which, in turn, could result in a second conformational change that then allows recognition of the A box by the APC/C, followed by full ubiquitination and degradation. In this model, the A box in the context of the full-length protein would be blocked from APC/C recognition by the nonubiquitinated D box region and unmasked following D box-dependent ubiquitination. When expressed as a short domain, the dephosphorylated A box in the N-terminal fragment 1–136 would be accessible to recognition by the APC/CCdh1. Although this model remains to be tested, dephosphorylation of the A box as the first step is most consistent with the fact that partially ubiquitinated Aur-derivatives, either directed by the A box or the D box, were never seen to accumulate when full-length proteins were assayed. This suggests that dephosphorylation of the A box probably represents the first step.  Cyclin B provides the earliest and, even now, the best understood example of how mutation of a destruction motif affects cell cycle progression. Single point mutations in the cyclin B D box completely block its destruction during mitotic exit, resulting in constitutive activation of its partner kinase cdc2 and cell cycle arrest at anaphase onset (Glotzer et al. 1991; Holloway et al. 1993; Parry and O'Farrell 2001; Stemmann et al. 2001). Stable cyclin A also has dramatic effects, delaying or blocking progression through metaphase, depending on the experimental set-up (den Elzen and Pines 2001; Jacobs et al. 2001; Parry and O'Farrell 2001). Recent studies in which Aur-A was introduced by transient transfections, which typically lead to considerable overexpression, had shown that higher than normal levels of Aur-A result in abnormal cells but do not block cell cycle progression (Meraldi et al. 2002). However, the specific effects of nondegradable mutants were not tested. Hoping to distinguish between a simple overexpression phenotype resulting from the accumulation of nondegradable Aur-A and the effect of a nondegradable mutant, we used retroviral-mediated infection to obtain stable cell lines of early passage NIH3T3 cells expressing very low levels of Aur-A. Introduction of either type of nondegradable mutant had the same effects, with no evidence of specific arrest points. It is of course possible that live analysis of single cells carrying mutant versus wild-type Aur-A, or expression of the mutants at higher levels, will reveal important differences, and those studies are underway.  Even modest overexpression of catalytically inactive Aur-A rapidly generates aneuploid cells containing multiple centrosomes, probably through association with interacting proteins such as scaffolds, upstream activators, or downstream targets (Ferrell 2000). In contrast, Aur-A's ability to transform cells and cause tumors absolutely requires its catalytic activity (Bischoff et al. 1998; T. Andresson, L. Amundedottir, P. Leder, and J. Ruderman, in prep.). Thus, in addition to looking for interacting proteins, identifying additional downstream targets of Aur-A is of considerable interest. The finding that Aur-A kinase activity oscillates after fertilization in the face of constant protein levels indicates that, in the early embryonic cycles, periodic activation and inactivation of its kinase activity is the sole mode of regulating Aur-A function. The Xenopus egg system, which is unencumbered by the complications of ongoing Aur-A transcription, synthesis, and destruction, provides an especially favorable system for identifying the upstream regulators that control the periodic activation and inactivation of Aur-A kinase activity.

       "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a complex disease comprising diverse subtypes and genetic profiles. Possibly due to the prevalence of genetic alterations activating canonical NF-κB activity, a role for oncogenic lesions that activate the alternative NF-κB pathway in DLBCL has remained elusive. Here we show that deletion/mutation of TRAF3, a negative regulator of the alternative NF-κB pathway, occurs in ∼15% of DLBCLs, and that it often coexists with BCL6 translocation, which prevents terminal B cell differentiation. Accordingly, in a mouse model constitutive activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway cooperates with BCL6 deregulation in DLBCL development. This work demonstrates a key oncogenic role for the alternative NF-κB pathway in DLBCL development.  Go to: Introduction DLBCL, the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a genetically, phenotypically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Various DLBCL subtypes have been revealed by gene expression profile analysis using distinct classification schemes, that is according to their putative cell of origin or the coordinated expression of consensus clusters (Alizadeh et al., 2000; Monti et al., 2005). In the “cell of origin” classification, two main subtypes of DLBCL have been identified whose transcriptional programs resemble normal B cells at particular developmental stages. These are the germinal center B cell (GCB)-like DLBCL, presumably derived from a GC B cell, and the activated B cell (ABC)-like DLBCL, whose cell of origin is less clear but may correspond to a cell undergoing plasmacytic differentiation (Lenz and Staudt, 2010; Wright et al., 2003).  Analysis of the coding genome of DLBCL has identified various genetic lesions and revealed their association with the GCB or ABC subtype. Inactivating mutations and deletions of BLIMP1/PRDM1, a key gene in terminal B cell differentiation, are found exclusively in the ABC subtype (∼30% of cases) (Mandelbaum et al., 2010; Pasqualucci et al., 2006; Tam et al., 2006). Similarly BCL6 expression is deregulated by chromosomal translocation more frequently in the ABC (∼26% of cases) than in the GCB subtype, where BCL6 expression is high a priori (Iqbal et al., 2007; Mandelbaum et al., 2010; Pasqualucci et al., 2011). Interestingly, BCL6 translocations are mutually exclusive with BLIMP1 structural alterations in ABC-DLBCL (Mandelbaum et al., 2010). Given that BCL6 can directly suppress BLIMP1 expression (Tunyaplin et al., 2004), it has been hypothesized that Balthough BCL6 controls multible additional functions in GC B cells CL6 translocations represent an alternative mechanism for BLIMP1 inactivation in ABC-DLBCL, although BCL6 controls multiple additional functions in GC B cells (Mandelbaum et al., 2010). Another group of mutations promote constitutive NF-κB activation, such as those affecting TNFAIP3 (A20), CD79B and MYD88, predominantly in the ABC subtype (Compagno et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2010; Ngo et al., 2011; Pasqualucci et al., 2011), and CARD11 mutations occurring in both subtypes (Lenz et al., 2008; Pasqualucci et al., 2011).  Notably, NF-κB activating mutations in DLBCLs, including the ones described above, predominantly involve the NF-κB canonical pathway (Compagno et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2010; Lenz et al., 2008; Ngo et al., 2011; Pasqualucci et al., 2011; Staudt, 2010). As a consequence, a role for putative genetic lesions involving the NF-κB alternative pathway remained largely overlooked. Supporting a role of the NF-κB alternative pathway in DLBCL pathogenesis, ∼10% of DLBCLs were found to stain positive for NF-κB2 p52 but not NF-κB1 p50 in the nucleus, and another 20% of cases exhibited both NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 nuclear staining (Compagno et al., 2009); furthermore, a recent study revealed that roughly 10% of DLBCLs carry deletions or mutations of TRAF3 or TRAF2 (Pasqualucci et al., 2011). TRAF3 and TRAF2 control the degradation of NF-κB inducing kinase (NIK) and consequently restrain activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway (Gardam et al., 2008; Hacker et al., 2011; Sasaki et al., 2008).  While an oncogenic role for constitutive canonical NF-κB activity has been demonstrated in a mouse model of DLBCL (Calado et al., 2010), a functional link between the activation of alternative NF-κB pathway and the pathogenesis of DLBCL remained to be established. In this study, we performed complementary human and mouse studies to investigate mutations activating the alternative NF-κB pathway and concurrent genetic events, and developed a genetic system in the mouse to test the role of constitutive alternative NF-κB signaling in the pathogenesis of DLBCL.  Go to: Results TRAF3 Gene Lesions Coexist with BCL6 Translocation in Human DLBCL  Deletions and mutations of TRAF3 have been found in human DLBCLs (Pasqualucci et al., 2011). To have a deeper look into TRAF3 genetic lesions and their distribution in DLBCL subtypes, we analyzed the TRAF3 sequences for the presence of point mutations and copy number aberrations in 119 DLBCL samples, including 98 biopsies and 21 cell lines whose phenotypic subtype was known. This analysis revealed missense, frameshift, and nonsense mutations (the two mutations tested being both somatic in origin) in functional domains, which are required for TRAF3 to negatively regulate NIK protein stability (Fig. 1 A; Annunziata et al., 2007; Hacker et al., 2011; He et al., 2007; Keats et al., 2007). Specifically, we identified one DLBCL case carrying a frameshift mutation (284fs) and one carrying a nonsense mutation (R310X), both of which are predicted to disrupt the MATH domain, required for the interaction between TRAF3 and NIK (Hacker et al., 2011; He et al., 2007). One additional DLBCL harbored a missense mutation (H70R) that may alter the function of the RING domain, required for the negative regulation of NIK by TRAF3 (He et al., 2007). Notably, a missense mutation affecting the H70 residue has been previously reported in a multiple myeloma patient (Keats et al., 2007). The present analysis also identified biallelic or monoallelic deletions involving the TRAF3 locus, including two focal homozygous losses that encompass TRAF3 and its neighboring gene RCOR1 (Figure 1B). A similar spectrum of deletions has been observed in human multiple myeloma and was shown to stabilize the NIK protein (Annunziata et al., 2007; Keats et al., 2007). TRAF3 deletions/mutations occurred similarly in GCB and ABC DLBCL (Figure 1C), and significantly correlated with alternative NF-κB activation, indicated by nuclear p52 staining (Figure 1D).  Figure 1 Figure 1 Recurrent TRAF3 and BCL6 Lesions in DLBCL We previously observed that constitutive canonical NF-κB activation promotes DLBCL development upon disruption of terminal B cell differentiation via inactivating BLIMP1 (Calado et al., 2010). With these observations in mind, we searched whether TRAF3 mutations in DLBCL associate with BCL6 or BLIMP1 genetic lesions, either of which would presumably disrupt terminal B cell differentiation (Mandelbaum et al., 2010). While none of the 17 DLBCLs carrying TRAF3 deletions/mutations exhibited biallelic BLIMP1 deletion/mutation, 6 of them (35%) had concurrent BCL6 translocation (the small number of cases analyzed did not provide statistical power to assess whether the co-occurrence is significant) (Figure 1E; Figure S1).  Taken together, these data show that roughly 15% of DLBCLs carry TRAF3 genetic alterations and that these lesions often coexist with BCL6 translocations.  Impact of Alternative NF-κB Activation and/or BCL6 Deregulation on the GC Reaction  To study the impact of enforced alternative NF-κB activation and BCL6 deregulation on the pathogenesis of DLBCL, we used a system of conditional gain- and/or loss-of-function mutagenesis in mice. Given that DLBCL arises from a GC or post-GC B cell (Shaffer et al., 2012), we decided to perform targeted mutagenesis in GC B cells, using the Cγ1-cre transgene, from which Cre is expressed in B cells at an early stage of the GC reaction (Casola et al., 2006). To induce activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway, we combined this transgene with a ROSA26 allele harboring a cDNA encoding NIK, preceded by a loxP flanked STOP cassette (hereafter called NikstopFL) (Sasaki et al., 2008). NIK expression from the mutant ROSA26 allele is indicated by a GFP reporter controlled by an internal ribosome entry site (Sasaki et al., 2008). For BCL6 deregulated expression, we used an HA-tagged BCL6 transgene inserted into the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain locus downstream of Iμ promoter (hereafter called IμBcl6), mimicking the observed BCL6/IgH translocation in DLBCL (Cattoretti et al., 2005). To monitor Cre-mediated recombination in cells of compound mutant mice not carrying the NikstopFL allele, we used a conditional YFP reporter allele in the ROSA26 locus designated YFPstopFL (Srinivas et al., 2001). Mice carrying the Cγ1-cre and YFPstopFL alleles served as controls.  To test the impact of alternative NF-κB pathway activation, alone or together with enforced BCL6 expression, on GC B cell formation, we immunized experimental and control mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs). Analysis 10 days after immunization revealed expression of the reporter, GFP or YFP, in the majority of GC B cells, indicating efficient Cre-mediated recombination in mice of all genotypes analyzed (Figure 2A). Control mice and mice with enforced expression of NIK and/or BCL6 also showed similar fractions of GC B cells at day 10 after primary immunization (Figures 2A and 2C). However, at day 21 post-immunization, mice with enforced NIK expression and thus constitutive alternative NF-κB activation alone had a significantly reduced fraction of GC B cells compared to control mice (Figures 2B and 2C), similar to what is seen in mice with constitutive canonical NF-κB activation in GC B cells (Calado et al., 2010). Enforced NIK expression in GC B cells led to increased expression of IRF4, which might, in turn, account for upregulation of BLIMP1 and downregulation of BCL6 in these cells (Figure 2D; Saito et al., 2007; Sciammas et al., 2006). We considered the possibility that the premature termination of the GC reaction in mice with enforced NIK expression might be due to the altered expression of BLIMP1 or BCL6 (Calado et al., 2010; Martins and Calame, 2008; Ye et al., 1997), however, concomitant BLIMP1 deletion (data not shown) or BCL6 enforced expression did not prevent GC early termination in these mice (Figures 2B and 2C). We next looked if activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway alone or together with enforced BCL6 expression affects physiological processes of GC B cells, such as somatic hypermutation. At day 21 post-immunization, GC B cells from mice with enforced NIK or BCL6 expression alone carried slightly reduced numbers of somatic mutations in their Ig heavy chain (IgH) V regions, compared to controls, while those from mice with enforced expression of both NIK and BCL6 had significantly fewer mutations (Figure 2E). The reduced somatic mutation load in the latter group is likely due to premature termination of the GC reaction, as similar levels of somatic mutation and AICDA expression were detected in GC B cells from these mice and controls when analyzed at day 10 after immunization, the peak time of the GC reaction (Figures 2C, 2E and 2F). Collectively, these results demonstrate that constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling through enforced NIK expression negatively impacts the GC reaction and that this effect is independent of BCL6 regulation. Hence, constitutive NF-κB activation is incompatible with the maintenance of a GC B cell phenotype, and may in a similar way impact the phenotype of lymphoma cells arising in the context of the GC reaction (see Discussion).  Figure 2 Figure 2 Impact of Constitutive NIK and BCL6 Expression on the GC Reaction Enforced Activity of the Alternative NF-κB Pathway Enhances B Cell Proliferation and Survival  To evaluate the impact of the constitutive expression of NIK and/or BCL6 on B cell proliferation and survival, we used an in vitro cell culture system where Cre-mediated recombination is induced in B cells upon treatment with anti-CD40 and interleukin 4 (IL4), mimicking T cell-dependent B cell activation (Calado et al., 2010). NF-κB activation through enforced expression of NIK not only improved survival of activated B cells but also increased their proliferation (Figures 3A-3C). Interestingly, in this experimental system concurrent BCL6 expression did not further enhance these effects (Figures 3A-3C). Overall, constitutive NIK expression led to the accumulation of increased numbers of cells in culture, with concomitant BCL6 expression having no additional effect (Figure 3D).  Figure 3 Figure 3 Enhanced Cellular Proliferation and Survival as A Result of Constitutive NIK Expression BCL6 enforced expression through a BCL6/IgH translocation Blocks Plasma Cell Differentiation Induced by Constitutive Alternative NF-κB Signaling  Enforced expression of NIK in GC B cells promoted transcription of IRF4 (Figure 2D), a key transcription factor for plasma cell differentiation (Klein et al., 2006). Accordingly, SRBC-immunized Cγ1-cre/+;NikstopFL mice displayed a significantly enlarged plasma cell compartment after primary and secondary immunization, compared to controls (Figures 4A and 4B; Figure S2A). In accord with the notion that BCL6 represses BLIMP1 transcription (Figure 2D; Tunyaplin et al., 2004) and the latter is essential for plasma cell differentiation (Martins and Calame, 2008), the plasma cell compartment was significantly reduced in Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice, compared to Cγ1-cre/+;NikstopFL mice (Figures 4A and 4B; Figure S2A). In line with the in vitro data that enforced alternative NF-κB activity enhances B cell proliferation and survival, while concurrent BCL6 expression has no additive effect (Figure 3), Cγ1-cre/+;NikstopFL mice displayed increased numbers of total reporter positive cells (containing both plasma cells and B cells) in spleen compared to controls (Cγ1-cre/+;YFPstopFL), and these numbers were not further increased in mice with concurrently enforced expression of BCL6 (Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice) (Figure 4A; Figure S2B). Collectively, these data suggest that a major effect of the deregulated BCL6 expression in GC B cells is a block of plasma cell differentiation.  Figure 4 Figure 4 Plasma Cell Differentiation Induced by NIK Expression Is Largely Abolished upon Coexpression of BCL6 Mice with Enforced NIK and BCL6 Expression in GC B cells Display a Shortened Life Span  We next assessed the role of alternative NF-κB activation with or without concomitant BCL6 deregulation in B cell malignant transformation, by monitoring the mice for tumor development over a period of 1.5 years (78 weeks). Mice with enforced expression of NIK displayed a similar life span as controls, while ∼40% of Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 mice died prematurely (Figure 5), consistent with a previous report (Cattoretti et al., 2005). In contrast, all mice with concurrent NIK and BCL6 enforced expression died within the observation period, suggesting a cooperative role (Figure 5).  Figure 5 Figure 5 Mice with Enforced NIK and BCL6 Expression Display a Shortened Life Span Plasma Cell Hyperplasia in Mice with Constitutive Alternative NF-κB Signaling  We decided to analyze the Cγ1-cre/+;NikstopFL mice in more detail and sacrificed them at the end of the observation period (1.5 years). Mice with enforced NIK expression displayed enlarged spleens (Figure 6A), and had a significant hyperplasia of both B cells and plasmablasts/plasma cells in spleen and bone marrow, compared to age-matched control animals (Figure 6B; Figure S3). Histological analysis revealed dramatically increased numbers of spleen cells expressing the plasma cell marker CD138 and intracellular Ig (Figure 6C). Serum protein electrophoresis further revealed that 8/9 of Cγ1-cre/+;NikstopFL mice displayed a distinct band in the γ-globulin region of the gel (M-spike), in contrast to 3/9 of controls (Figure 6D; data not shown), indicative of clonal plasma cell expansion. We conclude that enforced activation of alternative NF-κB signaling promotes B cell hyperplasia, in accord with previous work (Sasaki et al., 2008), as well as an expansion of the plasma cell compartments in spleen and bone marrow.  Figure 6 Figure 6 Plasma Cell Hyperplasia in Mice with Constitutive Alternative NF-κB Signaling Alternative NF-κB Signaling Cooperates with Deregulated BCL6 in DLBCL Pathogenesis  Macroscopic examination of terminally ill Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 (6 cases) and Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL (10 cases) mice revealed splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy in all cases (Figure 7A). Histological examination of the enlarged lymphoid organs showed that 5 of the 6 Cy1-cre/IμBcl6 mice analyzed had a DLBCL-like disease, characterized by a diffuse growth pattern of large cells, while the remaining mouse had a tumor with a plasmacytic morphology. Diseased Cγ1-cre/IγμBcl6;NikstopFL mice on the other hand all showed histological features of DLBCL (Figure 7B; table S1; data not shown). By flow cytometry these tumors were all negative for the plasma cell marker CD138, and displayed a mature B cell phenotype (CD19+AA4-1−IgM+ or occasionally IgG+; table S2). Analysis of IgH gene rearrangements by Southern blot revealed that the DLBCLs were of clonal B cell origin, and that the same tumor clone was present in both spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of each mouse examined (Figure 7C), indicative of an aggressive phenotype. We next amplified the rearranged IgH V regions from clonal B cell tumors of Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 and Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice (4 cases each). Sequence analysis revealed somatically mutated Ig genes in 3 of the 4 Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 tumors, and 2 of the 4 Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL tumors (Table S3), suggesting that a fraction of the tumors derived from GC or post-GC B cells.  Figure 7 Figure 7 Constitutive Alternative NF-κB Activation Synergizes with BCL6 in DLBCL Formation and Progression The activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway was confirmed in all tumors from Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice by the enhanced processing of p100 to p52 on the immunoblot, compared to tumors from Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 mice (Figure 7D).  In an attempt to subclassify the lymphomas occurring in our mouse cohorts according to the COO classification scheme, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profiling (GEP) by RNA sequencing (RNAseq). By IHC, expression of IRF4/MUM1 usually segregates with ABC-DLBCL, while high levels of BCL6 expression often associate with GCB-DLBCL (Choi et al., 2009; Hans et al., 2004), although a fraction of ABC-DLBCLs also expresses BCL6 in part due to BCL6 translocation to the IgH locus (Iqbal et al., 2007; Lenz and Staudt, 2010). All tumors analyzed were BCL6 positive, in line with the presence of the IμBcl6 allele mimicking the BCL6/IgH chromosomal translocation (Figure 7E; Table S1). The expression was however varied and particularly low in the cases where NIK expression was enforced (Figures 7D and 7E; Table S1). These observations suggest that the alternative NF-κB pathway was able to inhibit BCL6 expression from its endogenous loci, but not from the transgene, similar to what had been observed for the canonical pathway (Figure 2D; Cattoretti et al., 2005; Saito et al., 2007). IHC for IRF4 on the other hand revealed that all lymphomas (5/5) arising in Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice were IRF4hi, while a more varied pattern was observed in tumors arising in Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 mice, with two IRF4hi tumors; one tumor displaying both IRF4dim and IRF4hi cells; and one IRF4lo/neg tumor (Figure 7E; Table S1). To subclassify these DLBCLs, we compared their GEP to that of GC B cells and in vitro activated B cells (ABCs), in analogy to the strategy used for classification of human DLBCLs (Alizadeh et al., 2000). This analysis revealed that three (#603, #604, #775) out of five DLBCLs arising in Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice displayed a GEP similar to GC B cells, indicative of the GCB subtype; while the GEP of the remaining two (#607, #1128) Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 lymphomas resembled that of ABCs. Of note, tumors #607 and #1128 were also IRF4hi by IHC, further supporting an ABC subtype classification. In contrast, most DLBCLs (6/7; #817, #773, #920, #776, #611, #1078) occurring upon activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway together with enforced BCL6 expression (Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice) displayed a GEP similar to that of ABCs (Figure 7F). The remaining Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL DLBCL (#818) had a GEP resembling that of GC B cells, but because it stained highly positive for IRF4 we considered it “non-classified”. Thus, in our experimental system, the alternative NF-κB pathway and BCL6 synergize in the development of lymphomas that, in most cases, resemble ABC-DLBCL.  Mutations in Genes of the Canonical NF-κB Pathway in a Fraction of Mouse DLBCLs  Our genetic analysis revealed that a fraction (6/17) of human DLBCLs carrying a mutated TRAF3 gene have additional mutation(s) in genes of the canonical NF-κB pathway (Figure S1). In the tumors of Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice we detected variable levels of phospho-IκBα at Ser32/26 (Figure 7D). Phosphorylation at these residues indicates canonical NF-κB activation (Brown et al., 1995; Traenckner et al., 1995). For that reason we decided to analyze the RNAseq data of the DLBCLs arising in the compound mutant mice for acquired mutations affecting genes within the canonical NF-κB pathway (For the list of genes, see SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES). Interestingly we found such mutations in 2 out of 7 DLBCLs arising in Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice (Figure S4). More specifically, DLBCLs #773 and #776 harbored the same mutation (R218H) in the MYD88 gene, and increased levels of phospho-IκBα were seen in DLBCL #773 compared to other tumors of the same genotype and normal splenic tissue from a Cγ1-cre/+ mouse (Figure 7D), suggesting a functional role for this mutation (Ngo et al., 2011). We also analyzed RNAseq data of the DLBCLs arising in mice with enforced BCL6 expression alone for the presence of mutations in genes of both canonical and alternative pathways of NF-κB (For the list of genes, see SUPPLEMENTAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES). We found that 2 out of 5 such DLBCLs had acquired mutations in either the CK1α kinase or CARD11 gene (Figure S4; Bidere et al., 2009; Lenz et al., 2008). DLBCL #1128 had a mutation in the CK1α kinase domain, and displayed elevated phospho-IκBα compared to the normal spleen control (Figure 7D). These observations are consistent with the observed IRF4 expression in this tumor and classification as ABC-DLBCL (Figure 7F). Another Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL derived DLBCL (#603) displayed a mutation in the CARD11 (D401N) coiled-coil domain, to which the CARD11 mutations in human DLBCL are confined (Lenz et al., 2008), and this lymphoma also showed elevated levels of phospho-IκBα compared to the normal spleen control (Figure 7D). Despite canonical NF-κB pathway activation, this tumor was classified as a GCB-DLBCL by GEP profiling. Interestingly, the same exact mutation has been found in a human GCB-DLBCL (Morin et al., 2011). This is consistent with previous observations in human DLBCL, where canonical NF-κB activation could be detected in ∼20% of GCB-DLBCLs (Compagno et al., 2009). Collectively, our data show that a fraction of the tumors arising in both Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6 and Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice have acquired mutations in genes of the canonical NF-κB pathway that are also affected in human DLBCL (Compagno et al., 2009; Pasqualucci et al., 2011).  Go to: Discussion A Causal Role of Alternative NF-κB Activation in DLBCL  Recent studies of human DLBCLs have identified various genetic lesions that activate NF-κB through the canonical pathway, and revealed their association predominantly with the ABC over the GCB subtype (Compagno et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2010; Kato et al., 2009; Lenz et al., 2008; Ngo et al., 2011; Pasqualucci et al., 2011), in accord with the observation that ABC- but not GCB-DLBCL cell lines rely on constitutive canonical NF-κB signaling for survival (Davis et al., 2001; Staudt, 2010). Using a mouse model, we had previously established an oncogenic role for constitutive canonical NF-κB activity in ABC-DLBCL pathogenesis (Calado et al., 2010). In contrast, the question whether enforced activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway can be functionally involved in DLBCL pathogenesis has not been addressed, despite several observations suggesting a role for this pathway in the disease. Thus, mutations affecting genes (TRAF3 and TRAF2) of the alternative NF-κB pathway have been observed in a subset of human DLBCLs (Pasqualucci et al., 2011); the NF-κB2 gene, encoding the core molecule for this signaling pathway, was originally identified by virtue of its translocation to the IgH locus in a case of DLBCL (Neri et al., 1991); and IHC data revealed nuclear NF-κB2 p52, reflecting activation of the alternative pathway, in a subset of both GCB and ABC-DLBCL (Compagno et al., 2009). While these data demonstrated alternative NF-κB activity in a subset of DLBCLs, a paper by Pham et al. (2011) claimed that in DLBCLs of all subtypes both the canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways are activated, through constitutive BAFF-R (BR3) signaling. However, in most DLBCL cell lines analyzed there was no evidence for robust degradation of p100 to p52.  To clarify these matters, and in particular to obtain functional evidence for a contribution of alternative NF-κB signaling to DLBCL pathogenesis, we first extended the analysis of TRAF3 mutations by studying a larger number of DLBCL primary tumors and examining the association of TRAF3 mutations with the ABC or GCB subtype. These analyses demonstrated that biallelic or monoallelic deletions/mutations of TRAF3 occur recurrently in similar fractions (∼15%) of ABC- and GCB-DLBCL, and correlate with alternative NF-κB activity in these cases. We then developed a mouse model system that allows conditional activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway in a GC B cell restricted manner, and found that activation of this pathway, in concert with BCL6 deregulation, leads to the development of DLBCL. This indicates a causal role of deregulated alternative NF-κB signaling in DLBCL pathogenesis. Interestingly, in this scenario the deregulation of alternative NF-κB activity appears to be required in the context of GC B cell differentiation. Deletion of TRAF3 in mouse B cells from early developmental stages via CD19-cre leads to the formation of B1 and marginal zone B cell lymphomas, not DLBCL (Moore et al., 2012). These tumors resemble human splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), where inactivating mutations of TRAF3 have also been found (Rossi et al., 2011). Together, these observations highlight the importance of ontogenetic timing in the acquisition of oncogenic somatic mutations driving different classes of lymphomas. TRAF3 mutations/deletions are absent in follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (data not shown).  Of note, we observed that most Cγ1-cre/IμBcl6;NikstopFL mice developed DLBCLs of the ABC subtype. This observation is likely related to the fact that activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway interferes with the GC reaction even when BCL6 expression is deregulated and suggests that, in NF-κB positive human GCB-DLBCLs, additional mutation(s) allowing maintenance of the GCB phenotype must exist. Future studies comparing genetic lesions in the GCB vs. ABC types of DLBCLs carrying TRAF3 lesions may lead to the identification of those latter events.  Interference with Terminal B cell Differentiation Is Required for the Pathogenesis of ABC-DLBCL: A Role for BCL6  Constitutive NF-κB signaling in B cells promotes their differentiation towards plasma cells, through induction of IRF4 (Grumont and Gerondakis, 2000; Klein et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2007; Sciammas et al., 2006), in line with the presence of genetic lesions leading to constitutive NF-κB signaling in multiple myeloma (Annunziata et al., 2007; Keats et al., 2007). The observations that ABC-DLBCLs express some key genes characteristic of a plasmablast (Lenz and Staudt, 2010; Wright et al., 2003), but often carry genetic lesions interfering with plasma cell differentiation, suggest that the transformation of an ABC into DLBCL requires interference with terminal B cell differentiation (Lenz and Staudt, 2010; Staudt, 2010). Indeed, mice with specific activation of the canonical NF-κB signaling pathway in GC B cells developed plasma cell hyperplasia and had an overall normal life span, but succumbed to ABC-like DLBCL when B cell terminal differentiation was abolished by deletion of Blimp1 (Calado et al., 2010). Similarly, we show here that mice with activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway alone in GC B cells do not succumb to tumors in the time-frame of this study but display overt plasma cell hyperplasia, and that the oncogenic role of the alternative NF-κB pathway is revealed upon interference with plasma cell differentiation through enforced BCL6 expression, in accord with the coexistence of TRAF3 and BCL6 mutations in human DLBCL.  Our work indicates that the role of BCL6 in the development of DLBCLs exhibiting constitutive NF-κB signaling is at least in part due to its ability to inhibit BLIMP1 expression, which in turn limits the terminal differentiation of B cells. This is supported by data showing that in the mouse, loss of BLIMP1 cooperates with alternative NF-κB signaling in DLBCL formation (data not shown). However, the fact that human DLBCLs with alternative NF-κB activation are often concurrent with BCL6 translocation but not BLIMP1 inactivation, suggests that other functions of BCL6, such as repression of the DNA damage response (Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2010) may also be critically required to complement alternative NF-κB signaling in DLBCL development.  Alternative and Canonical NF-κB Pathway Activation in DLBCLs  While mechanisms of aberrant NF-κB activation in DLBCL can in the major fraction of the cases be attributed to the presence of oncogenic mutations in genes related to the canonical NF-κB pathway (Compagno et al., 2009; Davis et al., 2010; Lenz et al., 2008; Ngo et al., 2011; Pasqualucci et al., 2011), previous data and the present work show that genetic lesions activating the alternative NF-κB pathway occur in up to 15% of DLBCLs. It is worth noting in this context that besides the ∼10% DLBCL cases demonstrating nuclear NF-κB activity exclusively for the alternative pathway (indicated by nuclear staining of p52 but not p50), ∼20% of DLBCLs display nuclear staining for both p50 and p52 (Compagno et al., 2009), suggesting the activation of both canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways. Indeed, our genetic analysis showed that a fraction (6/17) of TRAF3 mutated DLBCLs carry concurrent mutation(s) in genes of the canonical NF-κB pathway. Likewise, while the present mouse model suggests that the alternative pathway can by itself drive DLBCL development if combined with a lesion preventing plasma cell differentiation, it became apparent that in a small fraction (2/7) of the resulting tumors additional mutations accumulated which resulted in the activation of canonical NF-κB signaling. We have previously observed redundancy between the canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways to replace BAFF-mediated survival signals in B cells (Sasaki et al., 2008; Sasaki et al., 2006), and there is evidence in the human that NIK activation can also trigger canonical NF-κB activity (Annunziata et al., 2007; O'Mahony et al., 2000). Given that the NIK allele used in the present study yields only a moderate cell survival advantage, in sharp contrast to a NIK allele lacking the TRAF3 binding site (Sasaki et al., 2008), we speculate that in a NIK-expressing B cell acquisition of an activating canonical NF-κB mutation may confer a further survival advantage, enabling the cell to outcompete its siblings during the clonal evolution of lymphoma. A similar mechanism may operate in human DLBCL pathogenesis. Overall, the current work provides a rationale for the design of therapies targeting the alternative NF-κB pathway in a fraction of DLBCL patients, and suggests that for those human DLBCLs that display both canonical and alternative NF-κB mutations (Compagno et al., 2009; Pasqualucci et al., 2011), targeting both arms of NF-κB signaling may be required for therapeutic intervention, as recently demonstrated for multiple myeloma (Fabre et al., 2012).  Go to: Experimental Procedures Sequencing analysis and High-density SNP Array Analysis of Human DLBCLs  119 DLBCL samples, including 98 biopsies (47 GCB and 51 ABC/NC-DLBCLs) and 21 cell lines (14 GCB and 7 ABC-DLBCLs), were analyzed as described previously (Pasqualucci et al., 2011). Oligonucleotides and conditions used for TRAF3 amplification are available upon request.  Mice, Immunization, and Tumor Cohorts  Cγ1-cre, NikstopFL, Blimp1FF, IμBcl6 and YFPstopFL alleles have been described (Casola et al., 2006; Cattoretti et al., 2005; Ohinata et al., 2005; Sasaki et al., 2008; Srinivas et al., 2001). 8-10 weeks old mice were immunized i.v. with 1 × 109 SRBCs (Cedarlane) in PBS. Mouse cohorts for tumor development were given monthly antigenic stimulation by SRBC immunization for 7 additional times, and then monitored twice a week for tumor development and euthanized if signs of tumor development occurred. All animal care and procedures followed National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC 03341) of Harvard University and the Immune Disease Institute.  Statistical Analysis  Unless otherwise indicated, data were analyzed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t test; a p value ≤0.05 was considered significant. A single asterisk (*) in the graphs of figures represents a p value ≤0.05, double asterisks (**) a p value ≤0.01, and triple asterisks (***) a p value ≤0.001, and “ns” stands for not statistically significant, i.e., a p value >0.05. Survival curves were compared using the log rank test. Data in text and figures are represented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), unless otherwise indicated.   Significance  In DLBCL the mechanisms of aberrant NF-κB activation have been predominantly attributed to oncogenic mutations in genes related to the canonical NF-κB pathway. Hence genetic lesions that lead to activation of the alternative NF-κB signaling have been less studied. We find through the analysis of human DLBCLs and genetic modeling in mice that the alternative NF-κB pathway also plays a key role in DLBCL development. Similar to canonical NF-κB activity, the oncogenic role of alternative NF-κB signaling is revealed upon block of terminal B cell differentiation. This suggests that therapeutic targeting of DLBCLs should take both arms of the NF-κB pathway in consideration. The mouse model presented here should prove useful in developing such therapies.

Recently, activating FGFR3 mutations have also been found to be present in cancer, i.e. at high frequency in carcinoma of the bladder and rarely in multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the cervix. Almost all reported mutations in carcinomas corresponded to the mutations identified in thanatophoric dysplasia. We here screened a series of 297 bladder tumours and found three FGFR3 somatic mutations (G380/382R; K650/652M and K650/652T) that were not previously identified in carcinomas or thanatophoric dysplasia. Another novel finding was the occurrence of two simultaneous FGFR3 mutations in four tumours. Two of the three new mutations in bladder cancer, the G380/382R and the K650/652M mutations, were previously reported in achondroplasia and SADDAN, respectively. These syndromes entail a longer life span than thanatophoric dysplasia. The K650/652T mutation has not previously been detected in patients with skeletal disorders, but affects a codon that has been shown to be affected in some cases of thanatophoric dysplasia, SADDAN and hypochondroplasia. From a clinical perspective, the patients with FGFR3-related, non-lethal skeletal disorders might be at a higher risk for development of bladder tumours than the general population.

These receptors consist of three glycosylated extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig-like), a transmembrane domain and a split intracellular tyrosine-kinase domain. Ligand binding induces FGFR dimerisation, resulting in autophosphorylation of the kinase domain and interaction with and phosphorylation of effector signalling proteins.1,2 Alternative mRNA splicing mechanisms generate many different receptor isoforms, which differ in ligand specificity. The isoforms FGFR3b and FGFR3c result from a mutually exclusive splicing event, in which the second half of the third Ig-like domain is encoded by either the 151 nucleotides of exon 8 or the 145 nucleotides of exon 9.3 These two isoforms have different tissue distributions: for example, FGFR3b is the main form in epithelial cells whereas FGFR3c is the predominant form in chondrocytes.3,4,5  Point mutations in specific domains of FGFR3 are associated with autosomal dominant dwarfism and craniosynostosis syndromes such as hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia (the most common form of skeletal dysplasia), severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans (SADDAN), thanatophoric dysplasia (a lethal form of dwarfism), Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis.3,6,7 Several reports have demonstrated that these mutations lead to constitutive activation of the receptor.8,9,10,11  In contrast with the inhibitory role on bone growth, an oncogenic role for FGFR3 in human cancer has emerged. Indeed, somatic activating mutations in FGFR3 have been reported in multiple myeloma and, more recently, in two epithelial malignancies, i.e. bladder- and cervix carcinomas.5,12,13 FGFR3 mutations are rare in multiple myeloma and cervix carcinomas,14,15 whereas their high incidence in bladder carcinomas (74% of non-invasive papillary tumours) suggests that the constitutive activation of FGFR3 is an important event for bladder tumorigenesis.16,17 Nearly all mutations identified in bladder tumours are identical to the activating mutations responsible for thanatophoric dysplasia, a lethal form of dwarfism.5,16,17,18 Only two of the 117 FGFR3 mutations identified by these groups, the A393E and K652Q mutations, do not correspond to thanatophoric dysplasia mutations.17,18 The A393E mutation is identical to a mutation associated with a craniosynostosis syndrome (Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans) and the K652Q mutation is identical to a mutation associated with hypochondroplasia.11,19  In this report, we describe three new somatic FGFR3 mutations in bladder tumours (G380/382R, K650/652M and K650/652T) (FGFR3c isoform numbering/FGFR3b isoform numbering). The G380/382R and the K650/652M mutations have previously been reported in achondroplasia and SADDAN, respectively. The K650/652T mutation has not been reported before in a skeletal disorder. In addition, among the 177 mutated tumours, we observed the occurrence of two concurrent FGFR3 mutations in four cases.   Materials and methods  FGFR3 mutation analysis was performed in a series of 297 bladder tumours as described.16 T7 Sequenase v2.0 (Amersham life Science, Inc., Cleveland, OH, USA) was used for sequencing to analyse the four regions of FGFR3, located in exons 7, 10, 15 and 19, known to harbour the point mutations previously described in multiple myeloma, bladder- and cervix carcinomas, thanatophoric dysplasia and SADDAN. None of the 297 patients had a hereditary skeletal disorder documented. The mean patient's age at diagnosis was 65.9 years (range, 23-90). Seventy (24%) of the 297 patients were female. The three new mutations of FGFR3 and all the 'double' mutations were confirmed on a second PCR product.   Results  In this series of 297 bladder carcinomas, we detected 181 FGFR3 mutations. Consistent with previous studies,5,16,17,18 most of the mutations (173 out of 181, 96%), were identical to the germinal activating mutations responsible for thanatophoric dysplasia, with the S249C mutation, found in 125 (69%) of the 181 mutations as the most frequent point mutation. The A391/393E mutation, identical to the germinal mutation that causes Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans and already identified in bladder cancer,17 was found in four tumours.  We detected three mutations in this series of 297 bladder carcinomas, which were not previously identified in carcinomas or in thanatophoric dysplasia patients (Figure 1). These mutations affected the codons 380/382 and 650/652 (FGFR3c isoform numbering/FGFR3b isoform numbering). The G380/382R mutation affected the transmembrane domain and resulted in the replacement of a glycine by an arginine residue. This mutation is identical to a germinal activating mutation associated with the most common form of genetic dwarfism, i.e. achondroplasia.20,21,22 The other two mutations (K650/652M and K650/652T), affecting the tyrosine kinase domain, resulted in the replacement of a lysine by a methionine or a threonine. The K650/652M mutation is identical to the germinal activating mutation that causes SADDAN.23 This novel mutation was found twice in this series of tumours. The matched constitutional DNA contained the wild-type sequence in every case, demonstrating the somatic nature of these mutations in (bladder) cancer. The tumour with the G380/382R mutation also displayed a S249C mutation in FGFR3. This patient suffered a recurrence 5 years later and the recurrent tumour was found to contain the same two FGFR3 mutations.  In addition to the above-mentioned case, three other bladder tumours also contained two distinct FGFR3 mutations. In each case, the S249C mutation was present. S249C was accompanied by the R248C, G370/372C and A391/393E mutations. The clinico-pathological data of the bladder-carcinoma patients carrying the new and the 'double' mutations are depicted together with the type of FGFR3 mutations in Table 1. We found no significant differences in the pathological status or the clinical data for the various FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer (not shown).  Figure 2 indicates the locations and the nature of the missense mutations associated with skeletal disorders and bladder carcinomas. The frequencies of the various FGFR3 mutations in bladder cancer are also indicated. These numbers are based on the previously published series by Cappellen et al5, Billerey et al16, van Rhijn et al17 and Sibley et al18 (n=273 patients) and the series described in this paper (n=297 patients).   Discussion  FGFR3 mutations occur frequently in bladder carcinoma.5,16,17,18 The vast majority of somatic FGFR3 mutations identified in bladder cancer are identical to those found in thanatophoric dysplasia.7,9 In the previous published series, only two FGFR3 mutations (A391/393E and K650/652Q) did not correspond to thanatophoric dysplasia mutations.17,18 However, both mutations have been found to be associated with milder types of skeletal dysplasia: the A391/393E mutation with the Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans and the K650/652Q mutation with hypochondroplasia. In this new series of 297 bladder carcinomas reported here, we identified 181 FGFR3 mutations. Ninety-six per cent (173 out of 181) of these somatic mutations have been previously reported to be associated with thanatophoric dysplasia. However, other activating FGFR3 mutations including the three described here for the first time in bladder cancer (G380/382R, K650/652M and K650/652T), have never been reported to be associated with thanatophoric dysplasia.  The activating G380/382R mutation, which affects the transmembrane domain, is responsible for almost all (~97%) cases of achondroplasia.20,22 Achondroplasia is the most common form of non-lethal skeletal dysplasia, affecting approximately one in 15 000 to one in 40 000 live births.7 This mutation is here reported in cancer for the first time.  The activating K650/652M mutation, located in the kinase domain, has already been found in SADDAN (severe achondroplasia with developmental delay and acanthosis nigricans)23 and in a primary multiple myeloma.12 Transient transfection studies have demonstrated that the K650/652M mutation results in stronger constitutive activation of FGFR3 than does the K650/652E mutation responsible for thanatophoric dysplasia.23 Nevertheless, despite multiple physical and neurological impairments, most SADDAN patients survive past infancy without the need for prolonged ventilator support.7,23  The K650/652T mutation has never been reported before in either skeletal dysplasia or cancer. However, other mutations of the same codon are associated with either thanatophoric dysplasia (K650/652E), SADDAN (K650/652M) or hypochondroplasia (K650/652N and K650/652Q).10,11,23 Bellus et al11 investigated all the possible amino acid substitutions resulting from single nucleotide changes in the 650/652 codon and showed that the K650/652T mutation leads to constitutive activation of the FGFR3 tyrosine kinase. This activation was equivalent to that observed with the K650/652N and K650/652Q (hypochondroplasia) mutations but was considerably weaker than observed with the K650/652E and K650/652M mutations associated with thanatophoric dysplasia and SADDAN, respectively.  The identification of mutations in bladder cancers identical (K650/652Q)18 or similar (K650/652T) (this study) to mutations found in hypochondroplasia suggests that other hypochondroplasia mutations, such as the I538/540V and N540/542K,T,S,V mutations in exon 13 may also occur in this carcinoma.6,24 In other words, possible hypochondroplasia mutations in other exons than 15 may have escaped their detection in bladder cancer. Among the 570 bladder tumours studied so far, only 89 have been studied for the hypochondroplasia mutations located in exon 13.5,18 No activating mutations were detected in this exon for the 89 cases. Nevertheless, the percentage of mutations not corresponding to thanatophoric dysplasia in bladder cancer might be slightly higher than suggested.  Another novel finding presented here was the occurrence of two simultaneous FGFR3 mutations in four tumours (case-numbers: 143, 172, 265 and 287, Table 1). The PCR-SSCP analysis of exon 7 in the case with number 404 provided a strong indication that the two concurrent mutations (R248C and S249C), are carried by the two different alleles (not shown). For the remaining three cases, this remains to be determined because these tumours had no loss of heterozygosity at the FGFR3 locus (not shown) and RNA was not available.  From a clinical perspective, the presence of FGFR3 mutations in bladder carcinomas, identical to the mutations found in patients with non-lethal skeletal disorders (hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia, SADDAN and Crouzon syndrome) suggests that the patients with these FGFR3-related syndromes might have a higher risk to develop bladder cancer than the general population. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on a higher incidence of cancer in these patients, so it is possible that the non-lethal FGFR3 mutations do not sufficiently activate the protein to an extent that is needed for tumour formation or other genes must be affected for bladder tumour formation. On the other hand, the predisposition may have gone unnoticed to clinicians, especially if we consider the relative low prevalence of non-lethal skeletal syndromes (~10 000 cases in the USA). For example, the retinoblastoma gene, cloned 18 years ago, has been demonstrated to play a role in many carcinomas, including bladder carcinomas. Yet, it was only recently proven that hereditary retinoblastoma patients have a higher risk to develop lung cancer than unaffected individuals.25   Abstract  A G380R substitution in the transmembrane-spanning region of FGFR3 (FGFR3Ach) results in constitutive receptor kinase activity and is the most common cause of achondroplastic dwarfism in humans. The epiphyseal growth plates of affected individuals are disorganized and hypocellular and show aberrant chondrocyte maturation. To examine the molecular basis of these abnormalities, we used a chondrocytic cell line, CFK2, to stably express the b variant of wild-type FGFR3 or the the constitutively active FGFR3Ach. Overexpression of FGFR3 had minimal effects on CFK2 proliferation and maturation compared with the severe growth retardation found in cells expressing FGFR3Ach. Cells expressing the mutant receptor also showed an abnormal apoptotic response to serum deprivation and failed to undergo differentiation under appropriate culture conditions. These changes were associated with altered expression of integrin subunits, which effectively led to a switch in substrate preference of the immature cell from fibronectin to type II collagen. These in vitro observations support those from in vivo studies indicating that FGFR3 mediates an inhibitory influence on chondrocyte proliferation. We now suggest that the mechanism is related to altered integrin expression. INTRODUCTION  Fgfr3 is one of four high-affinity receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate the pleiotropic activity of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of ligands. Alternative splicing in the third loop (iii) of the the extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains generate isoforms that vary in their affinity for the FGF ligands.(1,2) The b splice variant (iiib) is highly selective for FGF-1 and, to a lesser extent, FGF-9, whereas the more promiscuous FGFR3 iiic elicits similar biological activity in response to FGF-1, FGF-2, FGF-4, and FGF-9.(3) Binding of these ligands is facilitated by association with heparin-like molecules in the form of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which are found on the surface of many cell types and in the extracellular matrix.(4) As is the case with other receptor tyrosine kinases, ligand binding to FGFR3 results in receptor dimerization, transphosphorylation of residues in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, and signal transduction downstream through kinase casades. In addition to effects mediated directly through these pathways, growth factor receptors are also linked to pathways downstream of integrin receptors that mediate signals emanating from cell/matrix interactions.(5) It has been suggested that these signaling pathways merge with one another, and with cytoskeletal elements, in focal adhesions to coordinate the complex rearrangements necessary for cell proliferation to take place.(6)  FGFR3 is expressed in a restricted, time-dependent manner in a number of tissues, including proliferating chondrocytes in developing long bones.(7,8) Targeted disruption of the FGFR3 gene in mice resulted in skeletal overgrowth, indicating that FGFR3 mediates an inhibitory influence on endochondral bone growth.(9,10) Conversely, targeted expression of FGFR3Ach to growth plate chondrocytes, using the collagen II promoter, resulted in mice with skeletal defects arising from reduced chondrocyte proliferation and retarded maturation.(11) Consistent with those observations, activating mutations in the transmembrane domain (G380R), extracellular ligand-binding domain (R248C), and intracellular kinase domains (K650E) of FGFR3 result in achondroplasia (Ach)(12,13) and lethal thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) types I and II, respectively.(14,15) A correlation between disease severity and receptor activation was recently shown by measuring receptor mediated mitogenesis in BaF3 cells. In those studies the TD I mutation was maximally active in the absence of ligand whereas autophosphorylation of receptors with the G380R achondroplasia mutation could be enhanced by stimulation with FGF-1.(16)  Growth of the mammalian appendicular skeleton is dependent on the process of endochondral ossification during which chondrocytes pass through a program of maturation involving proliferation, differentiation, and programmed cell death. The stages of endochondral ossification are characterized by sequential changes in the synthesis, deposition, and degradation of extracellular matrix.(17) Progression through this program is regulated by poorly understood interactions between numerous systemic hormones and locally derived growth factors and morphogens, including parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP),(18–20) FGF,(21) Indian hedgehog,(22,23) and insulin-like growth factor 1.(24) The role played by FGF signaling in endochondral ossification, and the way in which it interacts with other signaling pathways present in chondrocytes, remain poorly defined.  The initial stage of chondrogenesis in vivo involves a progressive decrease in intercellular spaces with a reciprocal increase in intercellular contacts during a stage of rapid proliferation. This process is a prerequisite for chondrocyte differentiation and is accompanied by dynamic changes in both the production of extracellular matrix components and integrin receptors that bind to those components. These events of condensation and chondrocyte differentiation are recapitulated in CFK2 chondrocytic cells in culture. Constitutive expression of PTHrP stimulates proliferation, inhibits differentiation, and enhances the survival of serum-deprived CFK2 cells.(25,26) These alterations are similar to those found in the growth plates of mice expressing PTHrP driven by the cartilage-specific collagen II promoter(27) and opposite to those found in mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of either the PTHrP gene(28) or the PTHrP-receptor gene.(23) The CFK2 cells, therefore, represent a good model in which to examine the effects of growth factors and their receptors on endochondral bone formation.  In the present work we examined the consequences of expressing FGFR3Ach on CFK2 proliferation and maturation. Stable expression of the mutant receptor resulted in severe inhibition of CFK2 cell proliferation and differentiation as well as alteration of their apoptotic response to serum deprivation. These phenotypic changes resulted from altered integrin subunit expression and affinity for components of the extracellular matrix. Taken together, these in vitro observations support in vivo evidence that FGFR3 mediates inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation and suggest that inhibition is related to altered integrin expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS  Materials  All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY, U.S.A.) and all plasticware (Falcon) from Becton Dickinson Labware (Lincoln Park, NJ, U.S.A.). Fibronectin polymer and type II collagen, Hoechst 33258, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada), and glycine–arginine–glycine–aspartic acid–serine (GRGDS) and glycine–arginine–glycine–glutamic acid–serine (GRGES) peptides were from Bachem (Torrance, CA, U.S.A.). For immunochemical studies, the following antibodies were used: polyclonal antisera raised aginst α5 and β1 integrins, generously provided by R.O. Hynes (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cambridge, MA, U.S.A.); antisera to α1 and α2 subunits, purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA, U.S.A.); and monoclonal antibody AB6, which recognizes all four FGF receptors at a conserved epitope in the ectodomain,(29) a generous gift from A. Baird (Prizm Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA, U.S.A.). The rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR3 serum E1B2 has been described previously.(16) Plasmid construction  Expression plasmids encoding wild-type FGFR3 (FGFR3iiib) and the receptor carrying the G380R mutation (FGFR3Ach) were constructed as described previously.(16) CFK2 cell culture and stable transfection  The previously characterized clonal chondrocytic cell line CFK2 was derived from fetal rat calvaria as described.(30) Cells were maintained in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotic-antimycotic. Stable transfections were performed as described previously.(25) Selection of G418-resistant cells was continued for 21 days, with media changes every 3–4 days. For populations of cells, 300–500 colonies per 150-mm dish were trypsinized, pooled, replated, and expanded in medium containing 350 μg/ml of G418 before use. For clonal lines, clones were trypsinized individually using sterile glass cloning rings and replated in the wells of a 24-well plate before being transferred to 100-mm dishes. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for FGFR3 and integrin subunits  Total RNA harvested from CFK2 cells was subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with the indicated primers to amplify products from the indicated genes: 332 base pairs (bp) of FGFR3: forward 5′-AGAAGGCTGCTTTGGACA-3′ reverse 5′-TGAGCTGTTCCTCTGGCA-3′; 275 bp of α5 integrin: forward 5′-CTGCAGCTGCATTTCCGAGTCTGG-3′ reverse 5′-GAAGCCGAGCTT-GTAGAGGACGTA-3′; 262 bp of β1 integrin: forward 5′-AATGTTTCAGTGCAGAGCC-3′ reverse 5′-TTGGGATGATGTCGGGAC-3′ and 496 bp of GAPDH: forward 5′-GCTGTGTCTGAACATCAGCTACT-3′ reverse 5′-GATCCCAATGCATTTACAGT-ATG-3′. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting  Stably transfected CFK2 cells were lysed in 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.15 M NaCl, 2 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 5 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and FGFR3 was immunoprecipitated, using rabbit polyclonal anti-FGFR3 serum E1B2 and protein A sepharose, from supernatants containing 960μg of total protein. The immunoprecipitates were formed at 4°C for 4 h and then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Samples were denatured at 95°C in sample buffer, fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, U.S.A.), probed with the anti-receptor antibody AB6, and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (DuPont–New England Nuclear, Boston, MA, U.S.A.). For the analysis of integrin subunits, total cell lysates were prepared from control cells and those expressing FGFR3Ach 24 h after plating as described.(31) Thirty micrograms of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels before immunoblot analysis was performed. Determination of growth characteristics  Cells were plated at a density of 104 cells per well in medium supplemented with 10% FBS in 24-well plates. After 24 h, cultures were changed to medium containing 2% FBS supplemented with 1.5 μg/ml of heparin and FGF-1 where indicated. At timed intervals after plating, cells were either counted or pulse-labeled for 4 h with 0.5μCi per well [3H]thymidine (ICN), rinsed twice with PBS, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and solubilized with 0.2N NaOH. Aliquots were then used to assess [3H]thymidine content with a Beckman counter (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, U.S.A.). Counts were normalized to protein content. In situ staining for proteoglycan and alkaline phosphatase activity  Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 in 35-mm dishes in medium supplemented with 10% FBS and maintained with regular feeding for 7 days or 17 days. Cultures were fixed with 95% ethanol and stained for proteoglycan with a 1% solution of Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid for 30 minutes before being cleared in 3% acetic acid and rinsed in tap water. Alkaline phosphatase activity was assessed by rinsing cultures with PBS and incubating for 30 minutes with a freshly prepared solution of Fast red violet LB (Sigma-Aldrich Canada Ltd., Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and Naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.2 M Tris buffer (pH 8.3). After being rinsed with PBS, cultures were postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Stained dishes were then layered with 75% glycerol for photography on a Nikon Labophot-2 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a UFX-DX photomicrographic attachment. Characterization of apoptotic cell death  Cells plated at a density of 2 × 104 per well on glass coverslips in 24-well plates were maintained for 4 days in the absence of serum or growth factors and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline with Triton (PBST), and stained either with Hoechst 33258 to detect condensed nuclei or with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate–biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim), to visualize DNA strand breaks. DNA laddering was assessed as described previously.(25) Cell-attachment assay  Cells in log-phase growth were trypsinized for 4 minutes, resuspended in medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and plated at a density of 1.5 × 105 per well in 24-well plates pretreated with 0.02 mg/ml fibronectin polymer or 0.5 mg/ml type II collagen. After being left at 37°C for 2 h, the plates were tapped to dislodge unattached cells, and the remaining cell layer was trypsinized and the dispersed cells counted in the presence of trypan blue. Treatment with RGD peptides  Cells plated at a density of 5 × 104 per well in 6-well plates in medium supplemented with 10% FBS were cultured for 48 h before being changed to serum-free medium containing 0.1% BSA and 50 μg/ml of GRGDS or GRGES peptide. Treatment was continued for 6 h before phase-contrast pictures were taken, or for 24 h before trypsinization and counting of the dispersed cells in the presence of Trypan blue. Staining actin stress fibers  To detect the actin cytoskeleton, cells were fixed and permeabilized 12 h after plating on coverslips coated with fibronectin or type II collagen. Cells were stained for 30 minutes with FITC-conjugated phalloidin. After being rinsed several times with PBST, the coverslips were mounted in 75% glycerol on glass slides and visualized by indirect immunofluorescence with a Leitz Aristoplan microscope with a photomicrographic attachment (Leica Heerbrugg, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). RESULTS  We examined the consequences of overexpression of the wild-type b splice variant of FGFR3, and the receptor with the G380R mutation FGFR3Ach in the CFK2 chondrocytic cell line. The achondroplasia mutation had been shown previously to have partial constitutive receptor kinase activity(16) and to elicit achondroplastic dwarfism in humans(12) and in mice.(11) Populations of stably transfected cells and clonal cell lines expressing the wild-type or mutant receptors were screened for characteristics of proliferation and maturation. In all cases, cells expressing FGFR3Ach grew more slowly than either control cells or those expressing wild-type FGFR3, whether in the absence or presence of exogenous FGF-1. The results presented are those obtained for representative clones expressing wild-type (ciiib/6) and mutant (cAch/12) receptors compared with vector-transfected control cells (cVector).  Growth of control cells compared with those expressing FGFR3Ach  The presence of FGFR messenger RNA (mRNA) was determined by RT-PCR using primer sequences specific for FGFR3 (Fig. 1A). FGFR3 was expressed at a significant level only in cells transfected with complementary DNAs encoding FGFR3 (ciiib/6 and cAch/12). Figure 1B shows that control cells did not show detectable FGFR3 protein when the AB6 antibody was used, whereas those transfected with the FGFR3 complementary DNAs expressed significant quantities of immunoreactive FGFR3. This indicates that the protein in those cells was derived from the expressed plasmids.  Figure FIG. 1.  Figure FIG. 1. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses of FGFR3 expression in transfected CFK2 cells. (A) RT-PCR analysis of total cellular RNA harvested from cells expressing the wild-type receptor (ciiib/6) and those expressing the mutant receptor (cAch/12) showed increased expression of FGFR3 compared with vector-transfected controls (cVector). (B) Proteins immunoprecipitated with antiserum E1B2 (α-FGFR3) from lysates of transfected cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the monoclonal antibody AB6. FGFR3 protein was found only in precipitates from ciiib/6 and cAch/12, indicating that it was derived from the expression plasmids. Proliferation and growth of control cells, cells overexpressing FGFR3, or those expressing FGFR3Ach were examined using [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA and cell counts. Similar patterns of [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig. 2A) and cell numbers (Fig. 2B) were found for control cells (cVector) and those expressing wild-type FGFR3 (ciiib/6). No significant alteration to these patterns was observed when 10−11 M FGF-1 was added to the medium from day 4 to day 8 (open symbols in Fig. 2), although modest inhibition of [3H]thymidine and cell numbers was found in ciiib/6 cultures after 8 days. In contrast, [3H]thymidine incorporation, cell numbers and total protein content were drastically reduced in cultures of cells expressing FGFR3Ach (cAch/12) both in the absence and in the presence of FGF-1. Because no significant differences were observed when wild-type FGFR3 was overexpressed, subsequent experiments focused on examining the mechanisms underlying growth retardation in cells expressing FGFR3Ach. Parallel reductions in [3H]thymidine and cell numbers occurred when control cells and those expressing FGFR3Ach were stimulated with low concentrations of FGF-1, whereas the reponse to higher concentrations appeared to be blunted in cAch/12 (Figs. 3A and 3B).  Figure FIG. 2.  Figure FIG. 2. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Growth characteristics of transfected CFK2 cells in the absence or presence of exogenous FGF-1. [3H]Thymidine incorporated into DNA (A) and cell numbers (B) were assessed in cells cultured in medium supplemented with 2% FBS in the absence (closed symbols) or presence (open symbols) of 10−10 M FGF-1. Cells plated at a density of 104 per well were pulse-labeled with 0.5 μCi per well of [3H]thymidine, solubilized and counted at the indicated times. Little difference was found in the growth curves of control (▪) and ciiib/6 (|a9) cells, whereas cAch/12 (•) cells grew more slowly. Addition of FGF-1 (open symbols) did little to alter this pattern of retarded growth in cells expressing the mutant receptor. Results are means ± SD of triplicate determinations and are representative of 6 different experiments using both populations and clonal lines. Figure FIG. 3.  Figure FIG. 3.

Graph shows [3H]thymidine incorporation (A) and cell numbers (B) on day 4. Addition of FGF-1, up to a concentration of 10−8 M, resulted in approximately parallel, dose-dependent changes in cell proliferation. FGF-1, however, could not compensate for growth retardation resulting from expression of the mutant receptor (cAch/12). Results are means ± SD of triplicate determinations and are representative of 3 different experiments. Taken together, the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 show that overexpression of wild-type FGFR3 had little effect on CFK2 proliferation in the absence or presence of exogenous FGF-1. In contrast, expression of FGFR3Ach resulted in a drastic reduction in proliferation and growth that was not directly related to ligand-dependent receptor activation. This observation suggests that the signaling pathway downstream of FGFR3Ach may have been modified in some way. Altered apoptotic response to serum deprivation of cells expressing FGFR3Ach  The number of cells in a given population is a function of the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. We had shown previously that PTHrP expression in CFK2 cells not only stimulated proliferation but also inhibited apoptosis.(25) We therefore examined cAch/12 cells for evidence of altered apoptosis. After 4 days of serum deprivation, many control cells (cVector) had entered an apoptotic pathway, as evidenced by the presence of many blue-white condensed nuclei (Fig. 4A) and fluorescein-tagged DNA strand breaks (Fig. 4D) in the adherent cell layer. In cultures of cells expressing the mutant FGFR3, there was little evidence of condensed nuclei (Fig. 4B) or fluorescein-tagged DNA strand breaks (Fig. 4E). Chromosomal DNA harvested from numerous nonadherent cVector cells showed the characteristic pattern of DNA fragmentation indicative of apoptosis (Fig. 4C). In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, very few nonadherent cells could be harvested from the conditioned medium of the slower growing cAch/12 cultures, hence the reduction in DNA laddering. Examination of ciiib/6 cells under the same conditions showed similar patterns of in situ staining and DNA laddering as found in cVector cells (data not shown). Taken together with evidence of reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation in cells expressing the mutant receptor, these data suggested that the reduction in cell numbers could be accounted for primarily by a decrease in cell proliferation rather than by an increase in cell death.  Figure FIG. 4.  Figure FIG. 4. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Assessment of apoptosis in transfected CFK2 cells. Apoptosis was induced by serum deprivation for 4 days in control cells and in those expressing the mutant receptor before being stained with Hoechst 33258 to identify nuclear condensation, or with TUNEL labeling to identify DNA strand breaks (final magnification ×150). Many cells with condensed nuclei and fragmented DNA were found in the control cultures (A and D) but not in those of cells expressing the mutant FGFR3 (B and E). (C) Chromosomal DNA harvested from nonadherent control (cVector) cells and those expressing the mutant receptor (cAch/12 cells) was analysed for DNA laddering by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA fragments, with sizes corresponding to multiples of 180 bp, could be found clearly in DNA from cVector but not cAch/12. The molecular size markers in the two left lanes in C are lambda phage (λ) DNA cut with the restriction enzyme BstE and a 100-bp ladder. Results are representative of 4 different experiments. Inhibition of maturation of cells expressing FGFR3Ach  Chondrogenesis, both in vivo and in vitro, is dependent not only on the ability of prechondrogenic cells to proliferate but also on their capacity to form condensations of differentiated cells. In the preceding experiments we showed that expression of FGFR3Ach resulted in severe inhibtion of CFK2 proliferation. To assess the capacity of the cells expressing FGFR3Ach to differentiate, they were stained in situ for two commonly used markers of chondrocyte differentiation, proteoglycan and alkaline phosphatase activity. After 7 days, little staining was evident in either cVector or cAch/12 cultures (upper panels in Fig. 5). After 17 days (lower panels in Fig. 5), control cultures showed numerous defined nodules of differentiated cells that stained intensely for proteoglycan and showed high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity. In contrast, staining patterns in cAch/12 cultures after 17 days resembled those found at 7 days, demonstrating the inability of those cells to undergo the correct differentiation program.  Figure FIG. 5.  Figure FIG. 5. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Differentiation of transfected CFK2 cells. cVector and cAch/12 cells plated at a density of 2 × 105 in 35-mm dishes were brought to confluence and stained in situ for two different markers of differentiation after 7 (A and B) or 17 (C and D) days of culture. Cells expressing the mutant FGFR3 (cAch/12) failed to undergo the appropriate differentiation program, as evidenced by drastically reduced proteoglycan staining and minimal alkaline phosphatase activity (D) at 17 days, compared with vector controls. Results are representative of 4 independent assays. In total, these data showed that expression of FGFR3Ach resulted in severe growth inhibition, which was associated with impaired differentiation and an altered response to serum deprivation. Given the earlier observation that signal transduction downstream of FGFR3Ach might be altered, compared with the wild-type receptor, and that cell/matrix interactions influence chondrogenesis, we explored the possibility that reduced proliferation and aberrant maturation of FGFR3Ach cells was mediated through alterations in integrin expression and adhesion properties. Effects of FGFR3Ach on integrin expression and cell-adhesion properties  Throughout their life span, chondrocytes express a variety of integrin subunits, including α1, α2, and the newly cloned α10, all of which form heterodimers with β1.(32–34) Their changing patterns of expression over the course of differentiation results in alterations in the relative affinity of the cells for each other and for different components of the extracellular matrix. For example, the α5β1 fibronectin receptor predominates on proliferating, immature chondrocytes,(32) whereas α1β1 and α2β1 collagen receptors are preferentially expressed by more mature cells.(33) RT-PCR (Fig. 6A) and (Fig. 6B) immunoblot analysis of α5 and β1 integrin subunits showed reduced expression of α5 in the presence of unchanged β1 expression in undifferentiated cAch/12 compared with vector control. Immunoblot analysis of the same lysates for α1 and α2 integrin subunits revealed an increase in α1 and an apparent decrease in α2 expression (Fig. 6C) in the cAch/12 lysates. These data suggest that in cells expressing FGFR3Ach there may have been a decrease in the availability of α5β1 heterodimers (fibronectin receptor) relative to α1β1 heterodimers (collagen II receptor) at the cell surface. This hypothesis was tested by performing attachment assays with cVector and cAch/12 cells. Attachment to fibronectin was significantly reduced in the cells expressing the mutant receptor compared with control cells (Table 1). Conversely, attachment to type II collagen was significantly increased in the cAch/12 mutants  Table Table 1. Cells per Well Attached After 2 h original image Figure FIG. 6.  Figure FIG. 6. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis of integrin expression in transfected CFK2 cells: RT-PCR analysis (A) of RNA harvested from undifferentiated cVector (v) and cAch/12 (Ach) revealed amplification products of 275 bp for α5 and 262 bp for β1 respectively, compared with (B) the 496-bp GAPDH product used as control (c). Whole cell lysates from cVector (v) and cAch/12 (Ach) cells were prepared 24 h after plating at 1.5 × 106 per 100-mm dish. Proteins separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose and blotted with polyclonal antisera raised against α5 or β1 integrin subunits (B). Arrows mark bands of 160kDa for α5 and 130 kDa for β1. (C) Immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates shows bands of 210 kDa and 160 kDa corresponding to the estimated sizes of α1 and α2 integrin subunits, respectively. The results are representative of 3 experiments using 2 different lysates. Cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton  Expression of FGFR3Ach by CFK2 chondrocytic cells, therefore, was associated with a switch in preference from fibronectin to type II collagen. Proliferation of immature chondrocytes is enhanced by ligation of α5β1 to fibronectin in focal areas of contact to which cytoskeletal and signaling molecules are recruited. Control cells (cVector) plated on glass (Fig. 7a), fibronectin (Fig. 7c), or type II collagen (Fig. 7e) formed focal contacts and developed the actin stress fibers required for cell division to take place. Cells expressing the mutant FGFR3 (cAch/12), on the other hand, were only able to assume the correct stellate morphology when plated on type II collagen (Fig. 7f). When plated on glass (Fig. 7b) or fibronectin (Fig. 7d), these cells remained rounded and showed abnormal pools of actin and little evidence of stress fiber formation.  Figure FIG. 7.  Figure FIG. 7. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Immunofluorescent staining of actin in transfected CFK2 cells. Control cells (upper panels) and those expressing the mutant FGFR3 (lower panels) were plated on glass (A and B), fibronectin (C and D), or type II collagen (E and F) and left to adhere for 12 h before being fixed, permeabilized, and stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin to identify the actin cytoskeleton. Control cells showed well-defined stress fibers regardless of the substrate on which they were plated (A, C, and E). In contrast, those expressing the mutant receptor did not assume the stellate shape or show defined stress fibers unless they were plated on type II collagen (F). Results are representative of 3 experiments. To further investigate this apparent reduction in affinity for fibronectin, the cells were treated with a GRGDS peptide (Figs. 8A and 8C), which competes with fibronectin for binding to the α5β1 receptor, or a control GRGES peptide (Figs. 8B and 8D) that does not compete. In the presence of the GRGDS peptide, the majority of control cells rapidly rounded up and detached from the dish (Fig. 8A). In contrast, after 6 h of treatment with the same peptide, most cells expressing FGFR3Ach remained firmly attached to the dish (Fig. 8C). No apparent change was found in either the control (Fig. 8B) or the mutant cells (Fig. 8D) treated with the GRGES peptide. After 24 h, the number of residual cells was significantly reduced only in control cultures treated with the GRGDS peptide (table 2 in Fig. 8 legend). Because these experiments were performed less than 24 h after trypsinization, which strips the cell surface of endogenous matrix components, the results were most likely a function of altered integrin expression rather than altered deposition of endogenous matrix components.  Table Table. Table from legend of Figure 8 original image Figure FIG. 8.  Figure FIG. 8. Open in figure viewerDownload Powerpoint slide Competition for binding to fibronectin with GRGDS peptide. Control cells (A and B) and those expressing mutant FGFR3 (C and D) were treated for 6 h with 50 μg/ml of either GRGDS peptide (A and C) or control GRGES peptide (B and D). Numerous rounded cells (arrows in A) are apparent in cVector but not in cAch/12 (C) cultures treated with the GRGDS peptide. Little indication of cell rounding was evident in either culture treated with the GRGES peptide (B and D). The quantity of cells remaining after 24 h showed a significant change only in cultures of control cells treated with GRGDS peptide. Results are representative of 3 experiments. DISCUSSION  The results presented in this study show that expression of FGFR3 with the G380R achondroplasia mutation in CFK2 chondrocytic cells results in inhibition of proliferation and differentiation and confers resistance to apoptosis elicited by serum deprivation. These modifications to the cellular phenotype are related to changes in integrin expression patterns and altered preference for matrix components.  Signaling through FGFR3Ach and inhibition of CFK2 proliferation  Untransfected CFK2 chondrocytes express mRNA for the high-affinity FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 (data not shown) and are responsive to FGF1 at physiological concentrations. They also deposit heparan sulfate proteoglycan in their surrounding matrix during the course of differentiation in vitro,(26,35) which is believed to enhance binding of ligand to the high-affinity receptor.(2) The presence of both high- and low-affinity receptors for FGF supports the conjecture that FGFs act as physiological modulators for these cells. This hypothesis is corroborated by the established role of FGFs in the regulation of endochondral bone development in vivo.(15,36) In the current work, CFK2 cells showed a biphasic response to exogenous FGF-1. At 10−12 M, proliferation was reduced, whereas concentrations above 10−10 stimulated proliferation in control cells and in those expressing FGFR3Ach. Because FGF-1 is a universal ligand for FGF receptors, it is possible that at high concentrations it could have stimulated both the endogenous (FGFR1 and FGFR2) and exogenously expressed receptors to produce a net positive or negative influence on cell proliferation. Partial activation of FGFR3 resulting from the G380R substitution(16) may also have increased the sensitivity of the mutant receptor to its ligands, as suggested recently by Thompson et al.(37) Another possibility is that proteoglycan expression was altered at the surface of cells expressing the mutant receptor. However, because all assays were conducted on undifferentiated cells and in the presence of heparin, heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression was most probably not a contributing factor. Although these explanations might account for the more subtle changes in proliferation in response to FGF-1 (see Fig. 3), they cannot account for the severe growth retardation observed in cells expressing FGFR3Ach in the absence of exogenous ligand. The possibility that signaling pathways linked to the mutant receptor might be modified compared with those downstream of the wild-type receptor is discussed below. Apoptosis and differentiation in cells expressing FGFR3Ach  The decreased rate of proliferation found in CFK2 cells expressing FGFR3Ach was accompanied by an altered apoptotic response to serum deprivation. The lack of apoptotic cells in the growth-retarded cultures of cells expressing FGFR3Ach could be explained by the observation that CFK2 cells appear to enter an apoptotic pathway during mitosis. In the present work, the reduction in mitotic cells in cAch/12 cultures would, therefore, result in a lower frequency of apoptosis. Inhibition of proliferation could also account for the inability of the cAch/12 cultures to undergo an appropriate differentiation program. In the CFK2 model system, the nodules of differentiated, chondrogenic cells appear approximately 10 days after confluence has been reached. Wild-type cultures continue to proliferate during that 10-day period, and many cells die by apoptosis. Those that survive either remain as undifferentiated, mesenchmal cells or go on to form the multicellular nodules interspersed among the mesenchymal cells. In contrast, cells expressing FGFR3Ach cease to proliferate once confluence has been reached. This would account for both a decrease in the numbers of apoptotic cells and a reduction in the appearance of differentiated islands of cells. Is signaling through integrins altered in the presence of FGFR3Ach?  By virtue of its biological role, the chondrocyte is particularly dependent on its interactions with components of the extracellular matrix. When mesenchymal cells condense during limb organogenesis, fibronectin production increases. As the condensing cells mature, there is a shift to type II collagen production.(38) These alterations are accompanied by parallel changes in the integrins, which serve as receptors for matrix components, such that immature cells express primarily the α5β1 fibronectin receptor and more mature chondrocytes express α2β1 or α1β1 collagen II receptors. It was suggested above that signaling pathways linked to FGFR3 and FGFR3Ach might differ. In the current work we showed that control cells and those expressing FGFR3Ach showed equivalent expression of β1 integrin subunit in the presence of different α5 and α1 levels of expression. These changes would then result in alterations in the relative levels of fibronectin and collagen II receptors on the surface of the cells. This was supported by our data showing a decrease in attachment to fibronectin and an increase in attachment to type II collagen. Additionally, cAch/12 cells plated on type II collagen were able to form focal points of contact and actin stress fibers, which were not evident when the cells were plated on fibronectin or glass. The data showing that treatment of control cells, but not cAch/12 cells, with GRGDS peptide caused cell rounding and detachment was further indication that cAch/12 cells were no longer dependent on ligation of α5β1 to fibronectin as their primary means of attachment. In total, these observations indicated that signaling pathways, and more specifically integrin signaling, linked to FGFR3 and FGFR3Ach do indeed differ.  The mechanism whereby FGFR3Ach effects these alterations in the CFK2 cells remains undefined. Activation of FGF receptors allows them to bind to and phosphorylate intracellular proteins in either the ras-raf-MAPK or the phospholipase Cγ–signaling pathways.(39–41) More recently, Shc and a novel adaptor protein,(42) as well as a lipid-anchored Grb2-binding protein,(43) have been identified as potential members of FGF receptor–signaling pathways involved in cell cycle progression. Many of the molecules that have been associated with FGF-receptor activation have also been linked to integrin receptor signaling through FAK.(42,44,45) In the current work, it is therefore reasonable to predict that constitutive activation of FGFR3 (FGFRAch) might influence components of both MAPK- and integrin-signaling pathways. The observed down-regulation of specific α integrin subunits and altered focal contact and stress fiber formation supports this hypothesis. Our data is also in agreement with that presented by others that documents changes in chondrocyte morphology and proliferation as a consequence of inside-out signaling.(46)  In summary, we have used a model of chondrocyte maturation to show that expression of FGFR3Ach results in biochemical and phenotypic changes that include alterations in proliferation, apoptotic cell death, and differentiation. At the molecular level, these changes are accompanied by altered integrin expression patterns and actin stress fiber formation. These observations support evidence from in vivo gene targeting studies that indicate that FGFR3 mediates an inhibitory influence on endochondral bone growth, and they help to clarify some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the abnormalities observed in mice and humans carrying the G380R achondroplasia mutation. A point mutation, Gly380Arg, in the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) leads to achondroplasia, the most common form of genetic dwarfism in humans. This substitution was suggested to enhance mutant receptor dimerization, leading to constitutive, ligand-independent activation. We found that dimerization and activation of the G380R mutant receptor are predominantly ligand dependent. However, using both transient and stable transfections, we found significant overexpression only of the mutant receptor protein. Metabolic pulse-chase experiments, cell surface labeling, and kinetics of uptake of radiolabeled ligand demonstrated a selective delay in the down-regulation of the mutant receptor. Moreover, this receptor was now resistant to ligand-mediated internalization, even at saturating ligand concentrations. Finally, transgenic mice expressing the human G380R mutant receptor under the mouse receptor transcriptional control demonstrated a markedly expanded area of FGFR3 immunoreactivity within their epiphyseal growth plates, compatible with an in vivo defect in receptor down-regulation. We propose that the achondroplasia mutation G380R uncouples ligand-mediated receptor activation from down-regulation at a site where the levels and kinetics of FGFR3 signals are crucial for chondrocyte maturation and bone formation. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors (FGFR) constitute a family of four genes that encode multiple receptor isoforms, all of which have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (8, 12). Upon binding of a ligand, receptor dimerization is induced, leading to auto- and transphosphorylation followed by receptor internalization and down-regulation. These lead to the controlled activation of specific signal transduction pathways and the expression of FGF target genes, critically required during embryogenesis, tissue repair, and angiogenesis (1). Multiple mutations in FGFR 1, 2, and 3 (FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, respectively) give rise to a variety of inherited skeletal malformations (40). Mutations in FGFR3 are responsible for disorders predominantly of the long bones, including achondroplasia, the most common form of human genetic dwarfism (27, 29). Over 97% of cases of achondroplasia result from either a G-to-A transition or a G-to-C transversion, changing the codon for Gly380 (GGG) to Arg (AGG or CGG) in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3. An Asn540Lys mutation in the proximal tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR3 is found in the milder disorder of hypochondroplasia (2), while substitution to a cysteine of residue 248, 249, 370, or 371 in the extracellular domain or a Lys650Glu mutation in the kinase activation loop gives rise to the most severe and neonatal lethal thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) types, I and II, respectively (28, 33). All of these skeletal malformations represent autosomal dominant disorders characterized by disproportionately short limbs and relative macrocephaly (23). The cellular basis underlying the clinical features of achondroplasia is a defect in chondrocyte function during endochondral bone formation, the primary mechanism by which long bones elongate (22). This formation involves a linear process of chondrocyte proliferation and maturation in a very strictly time- and space-controlled manner (10). The cartilage progenitor cells which arise at the top of the epiphyseal growth plate proceed to form columns of proliferating chondrocytes that later differentiate to produce the calcified matrix. This matrix is subsequently remodeled by invading osteoblasts to form the typical bone structure underlying the cartilaginous growth plate (3). A disturbance in any of the stages in this tightly coordinated process is quickly reflected by an alteration in the normal pattern of the growth plate, resulting in inappropriate bone growth and short stature. The remarkably similar phenotype shared by achondroplasia-affected individuals, irrespective of their genetic background, suggests a unique mechanism responsible for this inhibition of endochondral bone formation. FGFR3 is highly expressed during embryonic development in the precartilaginous condensing mesenchyme and in bony and cartilaginous structures of the developing vertebrae (20). Later in development, during endochondral ossification, it is concentrated in the perichondrium, the resting cartilage, and the maturation and upper hypertrophic zones of the growth plate, where it may play a key role in terminal chondrocyte differentiation. Mice deficient in FGFR3 show remarkable skeletal overgrowth with wider growth plates, suggesting that FGFR3 exerts a negative effect on bone growth (5, 7). Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing FGF2 driven by the collagen type II promoter show shortening of their long bones and macrocephaly (4). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the various chondrodysplasia syndromes. The current dogma is that constitutive, ligand-independent activation of mutant receptors and their downstream signaling is the mechanism shared by all of these disorders (15, 18, 38). This notion is supported by the finding that many of these disorders result from substitutions to unpaired cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of FGFR, leading to covalently disulfide- * Corresponding author.

We found a specific defect in ligand-mediated receptor down-modulation of G380R which may lead to inappropriate levels and kinetics of receptor activation at a site where both are crucial for chondrocyte maturation and bone formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell lines. Nontransformed rat chondrocytes derived from fetal calvaria (RCJ 3.1C5.18), a generous gift from J. Aubin, and human embryonal kidney cells expressing large T antigen (293T) were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Expression of human wt and G380R mutant FGFR3. Wild-type (wt) or mutant receptor cDNA in expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was transfected into RCJ or 293T cells by the calcium phosphate method. For stable expression, clones were selected in G418 (GibcoBRL, Gaithersberg, Md.) (0.5 mg/ml) and screened for FGFR3 expression by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blotting. Retroviruses were produced in 293T cells cotransfected with vector pLXSN containing either wt or mutant FGFR3 and a Psi helper phage. Virus-containing medium, collected every 8 h, was filtered and kept at 280°C until further use. Infections were performed by incubating RCJ cells with virus-enriched medium and 8 mg of Polybrene per ml for 6 h followed by selection in G418 (0.5 mg/ml). Positive pools were screened for FGFR3 expression by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg of aprotonin per ml, 1 mg of leupeptin per ml, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 3 g for 15 min. The lysates were immunoprecipitated for 16 h at 4°C with anti-FGFR3 C terminus antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, Calif.) and analyzed by SDS–6% PAGE and Western blotting. Protein bands were visualized with horseradish peroxidase and an ECL kit (Amersham) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Covalent cross-linking. Cells were washed twice with binding buffer (DMEM, 25 mM HEPES, 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated at 4°C without or with FGF9 (50 ng/ml). After 2 h, chemical cross-linking was performed with 1 mM bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)-suberate for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with binding buffer and lysed, and the lysates were precipitated with protein A-immobilized FGFR3 antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with anti-FGFR3 antibodies (generated in rabbits with a purified recombinant kinase domain of mouse FGFR3). Analysis of pMAPK. Cells were grown in six-well plates. After starvation for 16 h with serum-free DMEM, the cells were incubated for 9 min either without or with 50 ng of FGF9 per ml and lysed. Equal amounts of each lysate were separated by SDS–7.5% PAGE, and the presence of phosphorylated MAPK (pMAPK) was determined by Western immunoblotting with antibodies against phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Fos-luciferase assay. RCJ cells were cultured in 60-mm plates at 37°C and transfected in duplicate with 0.5 mg of b-galactosidase cDNA with or without 2 mg of a c-fos promoter–luciferase cDNA. After 24 h, the cells were serum starved for 16 h, treated for 9 min with FGF9, lysed, and assayed for luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was measured by use of a Turner luminometer with luciferase reaction buffer (100 mM Tris acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.07 mM luciferin, 2 mM ATP). To account for transfection efficiencies, luciferase values from each transfection were normalized for the corresponding b-galactosidase activities. Metabolic pulse-chase labeling experiments. RCJ cells were cultured in methionine-depleted medium for 3 h, after which 35S-methionine (150 mCi/ml) was added for 30 min. Cells were washed extensively with DMEM and incubated at 37°C for various times. Cells were extracted, and lysates were precipitated with immobilized anti-FGFR3 antibodies. Proteins were separated by SDS–6% PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Cell surface biotinylation. RCJ cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline and incubated at 4°C with 0.5 mg of water-soluble biotin-X-NHS (Pierce) per ml in borate buffer (10 mM boric acid [pH 8], 150 mM NaCl). After 45 min, the coupling of biotin was blocked by an extensive wash with 15 mM glycine in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were incubated at 37°C for various times. To evaluate cell surface receptors, the cells were extracted and their lysates were precipitated with immobilized streptavidin (Pierce). The precipitated proteins were separated by SDS–6% PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-FGFR3 antibodies. Radiolabeled ligand internalization assay. FGF2 was labeled with 125I-Na (1 mCi) by the chloramine-T method (16) and separated from free iodine on a heparin-Sepharose column. Cells cultured in 12-well plates were washed with binding buffer (DMEM, 100 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated in the presence of radiolabeled 125I-FGF2 (5 ng/ml) without or with a 200-fold excess of cold ligand for 2 h at 4°C. To allow for ligand internalization, cells were transferred to 37°C for various times, at the end of which the cells were placed on ice and washed twice with low-affinity buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 1.6 M NaCl). The cellular distribution of the radiolabeled ligand was determined by use of a low-pH extraction buffer (25 mM HEPES [pH 4], 1.6 M NaCl) to remove cell surface receptor-associated ligand; the remaining radioactivity, solubilized in 100 mM NaOH, represented the internalized ligand. The extent of nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled FGF2 and was subtracted from all data points. Immunohistochemistry. Isolated bones were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) containing cetylpyridinium chloride (0.5%), decalcified in EDTA, dehydrated with an ethanol gradient, and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 mm) were cut, stained with anti-FGFR3 antibodies (Santa Cruz), and visualized with fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Vectra Laboratory). Slides were counterstained with methyl green (Vector) and mounted with Lemonvitrex (Carlo Erba). Negative controls were obtained by substituting normal rabbit serum for the specific antibodies. RESULTS Expression of wt and G380R mutant FGFR3 in chondrocytes. Since the cells most affected in achondroplasia are chondrocytes, we chose to study FGFR3 functions in the nontransformed RCJ 3.1C5.18 cell line derived from multipotential mesenchymal rat stem cells and expressing chondrocyte-specific differentiation markers (9, 17). Human wt FGFR3- or G380R mutant FGFR3-encoding plasmids were introduced into RCJ cells by stable transfection with full-length human FGFR3 (hFGFR3) cDNA driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter. Six independent clones expressing the transduced genes, as evident by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis, were selected. All clones transduced with the G380R mutant receptor were found to express higher receptor protein levels than those expressing the wt receptor (Fig. 1A). Two stable clones which expressed comparable levels of the two receptors (Fig. 1B) were chosen for further studies. Differential overexpression of G380R mutant FGFR3. Repeated transfections with different cell lines have always yielded, on average, more clones expressing the mutant receptor than the wt receptor as well as higher protein levels for the G380R mutant gene than for the wt gene under identical conditions. This finding suggested a posttranscriptional mechanism as the potential cause for the selective accumulation of the mutant receptor. To rule out the possibility that the apparent selective overexpression of the mutant receptor was due to clonal variation, the receptors were subcloned into a retroviral expression vector, and parental RCJ cells were infected with the retrovirus encoding either wt or mutant FGFR3. Pools of infected cells expressing either receptor were obtained and analyzed (Fig. 1B). FGFR3 migrates on SDS-PAGE as two discrete bands; the upper band is the mature, membrane-associated glycoprotein (130 kDa), while the lower band is the immature, nonprocessed form (97 kDa) (13). A comparison of immunoprecipitates from wt FGFR3- and G380R mutant FGFR3-expressing cells revealed a clear difference in the ratio of the 97-kDa form to the 130-kDa form. While in wt receptorexpressing cells the protein was present mainly as the 97-kDa form, in cells expressing the mutant receptor, more of the protein accumulated as the 130-kDa, mature form (Fig. 1B). The phenomenon of higher total expression levels for the mutant receptor was not unique to chondrocytes, as it was similarly observed when equal amounts of wt receptor- and mutant receptor-encoding cDNAs were transiently transfected into 293T human embryonal kidney cells (Fig. 1C). At such high expression levels, even the mutant receptor accumulated more as the 97-kDa form, most likely due to saturation of the posttranslational and trafficking machinery. Nevertheless, the expression of wt FGFR3 could be observed only at DNA conVOL. 20, 2000 SPECIFIC DEFECT IN DOWN-REGULATION OF G380R FGFR3 517 centrations of at least 0.1 mg/ml, while that of the mutant receptor could be easily detected at half that amount. Ligand-mediated dimerization and activation of G380R mutant FGFR3. Since receptor overexpression may by itself lead to spontaneous dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases, we investigated the ability of wt and mutant FGFR3 expressed in RCJ cells to form ligand-dependent and -independent dimers. Chemical cross-linking followed by Western immunoblot analysis failed to detect dimers of either wt or mutant FGFR3 expressed at moderate levels (Fig. 2A) in the absence of FGF9, a preferred ligand for FGFR3 (10). At very high expression levels, both receptors underwent spontaneous, ligand-independent dimerization and autophosphorylation (data not shown), which were more pronounced for the G380R mutant receptor due to its abnormal accumulation at the plasma membrane. Significant levels of receptor dimers were, however, formed only upon ligand binding to both wt and mutant receptors. Activation of downstream signaling pathways, such as MAPK (Fig. 2B) or that of the immediate-early gene c-fos, were also strictly ligand dependent for both receptor types (Fig. 2C). A more detailed analysis, including the activation of FRS2, JNK, phospholipase C-g (PLC-g), and Stat1 and using several different cell lines, revealed identical results (P. David, R. BenLevi, and A. Yayon, unpublished data). These results suggest that at least at moderate expression levels, the G380R mutant receptor, like its wt counterpart, does not form spontaneous ligand-independent dimers. G380R mutant FGFR3 is specifically defective in internalization and accumulates at the cell surface. In order to obtain more insight into the mechanisms responsible for the apparent difference in processing of wt FGFR3 and mutant FGFR3, de novo receptor synthesis and translocation to and from the plasma membrane were followed by a short pulse of metabolic labeling of RCJ cells expressing either of the two receptors (Fig. 3A). The immature form (97 kDa) of both receptors could be detected within 30 min after labeling with 35S-methionine. It took another 30 min for processing and for the 130- kDa form to appear. There did not seem to be a significant difference in posttranslational processing and trafficking to the membrane between the two receptors (Fig. 3A). However, a clear difference in the rates of internalization and degradation FIG. 1. Expression of wild-type and G380R mutant hFGFR3 in RCJ and 293T cells. (A and B) Lysates of RCJ cells expressing the wt receptor or the G380R mutant receptor were precipitated and probed with anti-FGFR3 antibodies.

Receptor dimerization, MAPK activation, and c-fos induction by wt and G380R mutant FGFR3. (A) Stable clones of RCJ cells expressing either the wt receptor or the G380R mutant (Ach) receptor were incubated for 2 h at 4°C in the absence (2) or presence (1) of 50 ng of FGF9 per ml. After chemical cross-linking, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR3 C terminus antibodies, and probed on an immunoblot with a polyclonal antibody to the kinase domain of FGFR3. (B) Cells incubated with (1) or without (2) FGF9 for 9 min at 37°C were lysed, and their lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-pMAPK antibody.

BIOL. between the two receptors could be observed. While the wt receptor remained intact for up to 2 h before it was internalized and degraded, the mutant receptor was not internalized during this time period and could be traced even after a 4-h chase (Fig. 3A). In another independent technique used to monitor the fate of the plasma membrane resident receptor, total cell surface proteins were labeled for 45 min with membrane-impermeable, water-soluble biotin-X-NHS. Stable RCJ clones (Fig. 3B) and infected RCJ pools (Fig. 3C) expressing either the wt or the mutant receptor were biotinylated, and their cell lysates were precipitated with immobilized avidin, separated by SDSPAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies to FGFR3 (Fig. 3B and C). As expected, only the mature, 130-kDa, membraneassociated protein band of both receptors could be detected by that method. Similar to the results obtained by metabolic labeling (Fig. 3A), the biotin-labeled wt receptor disappeared from the cell surface within 2 h after labeling, while the G380R mutant receptor remained stable on the cell surface for more than 3 h (Fig. 3B and C). Some variation in the time scale for internalization but not in the selective delay in mutant receptor down-regulation was observed between different experiments, most likely due to the variation in receptor expression levels. Taken together, these results suggest that the selective accumulation of the mutant receptor may be a direct consequence of its slower rate of internalization and/or degradation. Ligand-mediated receptor internalization is selectively abrogated in G380R mutant FGFR3. Cell surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases, are internalized upon ligand binding (30), leading to receptor down-regulation and signal transduction attenuation. We therefore examined the internalization and degradation rates of biotin-labeled receptors in response to a ligand (Fig. 4A). A major difference in the rates of internalization of wt FGFR3 and mutant FGFR3 was revealed. The addition of a ligand had a dramatic effect, as expected, on the wt receptor half-life, as in less than 30 min, most of the labeled receptor was internalized and targeted for degradation. Strikingly, the rate of internalization of the mutant receptor was not affected by the addition of a ligand in several different clones (data not shown), even at saturating ligand concentrations (Fig. 4A). Using a kinase-deficient version of the wt or mutant receptor, we found no effect of the FIG. 3. Metabolic labeling and surface biotinylation of wt and G380R mutant FGFR3 expressed in RCJ cells. (A) Stable clones of RCJ cells expressing wt or G380R mutant (Ach) receptors were pulse-labeled with 35S-methionine for 30 min. At the indicated times, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiFGFR3 antibodies and resolved by SDS–6% PAGE and autoradiography. (B and C) Stable clones (B) or infected pools (C) of RCJ cells were cell surface biotinylated for 45 min. At the indicated times, cell lysates were precipitated with immobilized avidin, analyzed by SDS–6% PAGE, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with anti-FGFR3 antibodies. Results represent three independent experiments repeated with different RCJ clones. FIG. 4. Ligand-mediated receptor internalization. (A) RCJ cells expressing wt or mutant (Ach) receptors were cell surface biotinylated for 45 min and incubated with (1) or without (2) FGF9 (50 ng/ml) for the indicated times.

(B) Cells were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with 125I-FGF2 and then transferred to 37°C for the indicated times. At the end of each incubation, low-affinity heparan sulfate-bound ligand was removed with a high-salt buffer, high-affinity receptor-bound ligand was dissociated under low-pH conditions, and the retained intracellular radioactivity was determined by solubilizing the cells in 100 mM NaOH. The results shown are the averages 6 standard deviations of triplicate measurements, calculated as the ratio between the internalized ligand and the receptor-bound ligand. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from all data points. VOL. 20, 2000 SPECIFIC DEFECT IN DOWN-REGULATION OF G380R FGFR3 519 ligand on the half-life of either receptor (data not shown); this result suggests that FGFR internalization may be strictly regulated by interactions with the intracellular domain, which in turn may depend on its kinase activity. In a more quantitative approach, the effect of FGF ligands on receptor internalization was examined by monitoring the level of the accumulated radiolabeled ligand with time. We found marked differences in the kinetics of radiolabeled FGF2 accumulation between the cells (Fig. 4B). Cells expressing the mutant receptor bound significantly higher levels of the ligand than wt receptor-expressing cells, reflecting the higher levels of expression of the mutant receptor but, nevertheless, internalized the labeled ligand at a very slow rate. Cells expressing wt FGFR3, despite having a smaller number of binding sites for FGF2, internalized most of this ligand in less than 30 min, while the internalization of the radiolabeled ligand by G380R mutant FGFR3-expressing cells was far from being completed even after 120 min (Fig. 4B). To investigate the effect of receptor stabilization on receptor activation, RCJ cells expressing wt or G380R mutant FGFR3 were treated with cycloheximide, which blocks the production of newly synthesized receptors. Monitoring of FGFR3 levels at different times revealed prolonged expression of the mutant receptor compared to the wt receptor (Fig. 5), in agreement with previous results (Fig. 3). This finding was, however, accompanied by a sustained capacity of the mutant receptor to undergo ligand-dependent phosphorylation, suggesting that as long as the receptor is on the cell surface, it is capable of ligand binding and transphosphorylation. The mutant receptor, therefore, not only accumulates at the surface but also is capable of signaling over a longer period of time than its normal counterpart. Expanded expression of FGFR3 in growth plates of transgenic mice carrying the human mutant receptor. To address the relevance of such a specific delay in receptor internalization to the localization of FGFR3 in the growth plate, we analyzed epiphyseal growth plates of transgenic mice which were engineered to express G380R mutant hFGFR3 under mouse FGFR3 transcriptional control and which show a phenotype remarkably similar to that of afflicted humans (28a). Immunostaining with anti-FGFR3 antibodies revealed that while the localization of this receptor in the growth plates of normal mice was restricted to cells in the upper hypertrophic zone (Fig. 6, left), transgenic littermates expressed the receptor in a significantly wider area of the growth plates comprising several layers of cells, including the lower hypertrophic zone (Fig. 6, right). No such difference was observed at the RNA level, as detected by in situ hybridization (data not shown). This result suggests that the mutant receptor may not be downregulated in vivo at the time and differentiation stage at which the normal receptor is down-regulated. FIG. 6. Immunohistochemical analysis of epiphyseal growth plates from normal and transgenic G380R mutant hFGFR3-expressing mice. Immunostaining for FGFR3 was performed on sections of proximal tibia growth plates from 8-day-old normal and transgenic littermates with anti-FGFR3 and fluorescein-conjugated antibodies. Cells expressing FGFR3 are indicated by white brackets. The different zones of the growth plate (PZ, proliferating zone; MZ, maturation zone; MZ, hypertrophic zone) are noted. FIG. 5. Expression and phosphorylation of wt and G380R mutant FGFR3. RCJ cells expressing either wt or mutant (Ach) receptors were treated for the indicated times with 10 mg of cyclohexamide (Chx) per ml at 37°C. Then, the cells were incubated for 10 min with 50 ng of FGF9 per ml and lysed. Each lysate (1 mg of protein) was immunoprecipitated with an antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Samples were separated by SDS–6% PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with antibodies to FGFR3. 520 MONSONEGO-ORNAN ET AL. MOL. CELL. BIOL. DISCUSSION Substitution of a glycine with an arginine in the transmembrane domain of FGFR3, as in achondroplasia, results primarily in the stabilization and accumulation of the mutant receptor at the cell surface. Transgenic mice expressing G380R mutant hFGFR3 driven by the mouse FGFR3-specific promoter and enhancer demonstrate a significantly extended area of FGFR3 expression similar to that observed in sections from human TD type I cases (6) and compatible with the detected prolonged expression of the mutant receptor in genetically engineered chondrocytes. The direct consequence of this specific defect in internalization is uncontrolled, prolonged, ligand-dependent activation of this receptor, which may contribute to receptor overactivation (15, 18, 25, 36, 38) and the observed inhibition of chondrocyte terminal differentiation typical of achondroplasia. This suggestion is well in line with the current concept that multiple mutations in FGFR responsible for human skeletal dysplasias are all gain-of-function mutations. Whether the observed selective overexpression of the FGFR3 protein in TD type I (6) and possibly of other mutants of FGFR3 results from a similar defect in receptor down-regulation has yet to be determined. Ligand-induced dimerization is a key event in the transmembrane signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases. A Val-Glu point mutation in the transmembrane domain of the Neu/ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase leads to constitutive receptor phosphorylation due to ligand-independent dimerization and activation (39). The G380R mutation in FGFR3, being in a position analogous to that of the neu mutation, was implied to function in a similar manner to constitutively activate this receptor (38). Constitutive activation of the mutant receptor was supported by experiments with chimeric proteins of FGFR3 having the kinase domain of either FGFR1 (18) or the neu oncogene (37), having the extracellular domain of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (24), or having a full-length homologous mutant of FGFR2 (15). Our results, like those of Raffioni et al. (24) and Thompson and coworkers (34), suggest that at moderate expression levels, the G380R mutant receptor, like its normal counterpart, requires a ligand for dimerization and activation. We have also found an equal capacity of the mutant receptor to dimerize with either a wild-type or a mutant receptor counterpart upon ligand binding, as evidenced by coexpression and immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). This finding may argue against mutant homodimerization via hydrogen bonding as the sole mechanism driving constitutive receptor activation in human achondroplasia. The discrepancy between the reported, albeit partial, ligand-independent activation and our above-mentioned results may be due to the use of different cellular systems, which may express variable levels of these receptors or their endogenous ligands (1) acting in an autocrine manner to stimulate the overexpressed receptor. Indeed, from our experience, it is not uncommon to detect significant basal phosphorylation levels of the wild-type receptor as well. One cannot rule out, however, the possibility that both constitutive activation and selective overexpression of the mutant receptor may act in concert to locally enhance FGFR3 signals. Tyrosine kinase receptors undergo ligand-mediated internalization following their dimerization and activation (31). Although specific data concerning FGFR3 internalization are not available, the mechanisms responsible for the internalization of other tyrosine kinase receptors are relevant to FGFR3, as evidenced by the increased rate of internalization of this receptor in response to a ligand and the lack of this effect in a kinase-deficient receptor. Our studies of internalization rates by several independent methods, such as pulse-chase metabolic labeling, surface biotinylation, and quantitative measurements of receptor-mediated internalization of a radiolabeled ligand, clearly establish a primary defect in the down-regulation of the G380R mutant receptor. The pattern of expression of the mutant receptor is distinct from that of the wt receptor in both total receptor levels and the ratio between the immature, unglycosylated form and the mature, membrane form of the receptor. The selective accumulation of the mutant receptor in the mature form is of particular importance, as it is this form which is capable of binding and responding to extracellular ligands by dimerization and downstream signal transduction. Such an accumulation of a fully functional receptor may also support the prolonged and persistent signals induced by a locally expressed ligand. It is expected that in the heterozygous achondroplasia state, a block in the internalization of the mutant receptor may eventually lead, through the process of ligand-mediated receptor heterodimerization (35, 39), to the excess accumulation and activation of wt FGFR as well. Such a transdominant positive effect of the mutant receptor can further contribute to the overall excessive and prolonged activation of FGFR-specific pathways. The molecular basis for the selective accumulation of the mutant receptor is not clear. It could be related to differential, posttranslational processing of the receptor. Introducing a positively charged residue within the interior of the hydrophobic membrane may also present an ionic barrier for membrane endocytosis or cause a change in receptor protein conformation crucial for the interaction of the receptor with intracellular components responsible for internalization. Alternatively, the lack of down-regulation may be due to a specific block in the transmittance of an internalization signal by the mutant receptor. FGFR1, with a mutation in Y766 autophosphorylation and in the PLC-g binding site, is defective in internalization and degradation (32) and leads to a hypomorphic gain-of-function allele resulting in vertebral abnormalities in mice targeted for this mutation (26). The disrupted down-regulation signal in achondroplasia may be different from that of MAPK, JNK, and Stat1 as well as from PLC-g-mediated signals, which seem to be properly activated by the mutant receptor. The fact that this phenomenon is also observed for 293T human embryonal kidney cells, L8 myoblasts, and CHO epithelial cells suggests that the internalization defect of the mutant receptor is an intrinsic characteristic of the mutant protein and is not cell or tissue specific, as could be implied from the selective defect in bone formation. Signals from FGFR3 seem to exert a selective negative effect on bone growth, as evidenced from the skeletal overgrowth of FGFR3-null mice (5, 7) and the severe skeletal growth retardation of mice overexpressing FGF2 (4). Moreover, FGFR3 mutations selectively inhibit endochondral ossification and long-bone formation without detectable abnormalities in other tissues, where FGFR3 is highly expressed (20, 41). The cellular context in which FGFR function seems to be of great importance, and their tissue-specific expression as well as the expression of their ligands is highly coordinated throughout development. Several FGF ligands were found to be expressed by growth plate chondrocytes (11, 14, 20, 21), and receptor activation in the growth plate can be readily explained by either autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. Ligand-mediated receptor overactivation is therefore an attractive mechanism to support an exclusive effect of mutated FGFR3 on long-bone formation due to the specific combination of ligands, receptors, and coreceptors, such as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, in this tissue and at different stages along the pathway of differentiation of epiphyseal chondrocytes. The process of longitudinal bone growth involves coordinaVOL. 20, 2000 SPECIFIC DEFECT IN DOWN-REGULATION OF G380R FGFR3 521 tion and precise balance among chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, cartilage matrix production, and mineralization within the developing growth plate. These cellular activities are under the influence of a variety of hormonal and local factors, such as FGF ligands (19), whose relative concentrations, sites, and sequence of appearance vary critically during development. It is this tightly coordinated process which may make the growth plate a most sensitive organ to a variety of insults, such as in achondroplasia.  The G380R mutation in the transmembrane domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) causes achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism. Achondroplasia is a heterozygous disorder, and thus the affected individuals express both wild-type and mutant FGFR3. Yet heterodimerization in achondroplasia has not been characterized thus far. To investigate the formation of FGFR3 heterodimers in cellular membranes, we designed an FGFR3 construct that lacks the kinase domain, and we monitored the formation of inactive heterodimers between this construct and wild-type and mutant FGFR3. The formation of the inactive heterodimers depleted the pool of full-length receptors capable of forming active homodimers and ultimately reduced their phosphorylation. By analyzing the effect of the truncated FGFR3 on full-length receptor phosphorylation, we demonstrated that FGFR3 WT/G380R heterodimers form with lower probability than wild-type FGFR3 homodimers at low ligand concentration. These results further our knowledge of FGFR3-associated bone disorders.  Keywords: Membrane Biophysics, Membrane Proteins, Protein-Protein Interactions, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, Signal Transduction, Dwarfism, Heterodimerization Go to: Introduction The G380R mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) transmembrane (TM)2 domain has been linked to achondroplasia, the most common form of human dwarfism (1). Achondroplasia, characterized by short stature, is a common (1 in 15,000 live births) autosomal dominant disorder that interferes with the maturation of the cartilage growth plate of long bones (2–4). The affected protein, FGFR3, is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Its activation, manifested in the autophosphorylation of its kinase domain, involves lateral dimerization and binding of FGF ligands and heparan sulfate (5, 6). Ligand binding increases receptor activation by stabilizing the dimers and perhaps altering the dimer structure (7–11).  In cellular studies, the G380R mutation increases FGFR3 phosphorylation in the absence of ligand and at low ligand concentration (12–15). The increase, which is the likely cause for pathogenesis, has been linked to an increase in the phosphorylation of the unliganded dimer (13). However, FGFR3 dimerization does not appear affected by the G380R mutation, as both the wild-type FGFR3 and the G380R mutant show very similar cross-linking and dimerization propensities (13).  Achondroplasia is a heterozygous disorder, and thus the affected individuals express both wild-type and mutant FGFR3. In this paper, we address the question whether mutant FGFR3 receptors heterodimerize with the wild type. Currently, the answer to this question is unknown. Most studies of FGFR3 activation thus far have focused on FGFR3 homodimers, because the detection of heterodimers is challenging. When both wild-type and mutant FGFR3 molecules are present in cells, three different dimeric species can co-exist as follows: 1) wild-type homodimers, 2) mutant homodimers, and 3) wild-type/mutant heterodimers (16). These dimers will be indistinguishable in many experiments, and their abundance will depend on the respective expression levels and on the dimerization propensities, which are unknown. Furthermore, the wild-type and mutant unliganded dimer structures have been proposed to be different (13, 17), and thus the formation and the stability of heterodimers cannot even be predicted based on previous homodimerization studies.  To investigate the formation of FGFR3 heterodimers in a cellular environment, here we designed an FGFR3 construct that lacks the kinase domain, and we monitored the formation of heterodimers between this construct and full-length wild-type and mutant FGFR3. Such full-length/truncated heterodimers will be inactive. They will deplete the pool of full-length receptors capable of forming homodimers and ultimately reduce the concentration of active homodimers. Thus, the presence of the truncated receptors will lead to a decrease in the phosphorylation of the full-length receptor if the full-length and the truncated receptors dimerize. This decrease in phosphorylation can be measured experimentally.  We use this approach to compare the likelihood of formation of FGFR3 WT/WT homodimers, WT/G380R heterodimers, and heterodimers between WT and a different pathogenic FGFR3 mutant, A391E (see Fig. 1). The A391E mutation in FGFR3 TM domain is linked to a different heterozygous disorder, Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (18). The G380R and A391E mutations are both localized in FGFR3 TM domain, and it is puzzling why they lead to two very different phenotypes (skeletal dysplasia versus craniosynostosis) (19, 20). Our results demonstrate that FGFR3 WT/G380R heterodimers form with lower probability than wild-type homodimers and WT/A391E heterodimers at low ligand concentration. Thus, here we provide evidence for a key difference in the behavior of the two mutants, namely a difference in the interactions between the wild type and the two mutants.  FIGURE 1. FIGURE 1. Overview of experimental design. The schematic depicts the three types of dimers present in each cell line. Only the full-length FGFR3 homodimers are active: wild-type FGFR3 is shown in yellow; the G380R mutant is shown in green, and the A391E mutant ... Go to: MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were maintained in the incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C.  Creation of Stable Cell Lines HEK 293 cells were transfected with one of the plasmids encoding FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, or FGFR3/A391E. Twenty four hours after transfection, culture medium was replaced by medium supplemented with 0.6 μg/ml Geneticin® (G418, Invitrogen). Two or 3 days later, the cells that grew to about 90% confluency were passed and seeded with high dilution ratio into 150-mm cell culture dishes. The medium with antibiotics was replaced every 2–3 days until colonies of cells appeared around 2 weeks after the initial seeding. Eight colonies from each dish were selected and cultured in 24-well plates. The expression levels of FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, and FGFR3/A391E were analyzed by Western blots, and three cell lines with the same stable receptor expression were selected. These cell lines were further amplified and used in the experiments.  Construction of Truncated FGFR3 Plasmids The plasmids utilized the pcDNATM 3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen), which contains a human cytomegalovirus immediate-early (CMV) promoter for high level expression in a wide range of mammalian cells, a T7-priming site, and a multiple cloning site. Genes encoding the truncated versions of human wild-type FGFR3 were constructed by ligation of the transmembrane PCR products using HindIII and XbaI restriction sites. The gene sequences were amplified using a forward primer with a HindIII restriction enzyme site and a reverse primer with an XbaI restriction enzyme site, prior to ligation into the pcDNATM 3.1(+) vector. The truncated constructs are shown in Fig. 1. ECTMWT-1 contains the complete extracellular and TM domains of FGFR3, ending at Arg399 (see Fig. 1). ECTMWT-2, ending at residue Ala391, contains the extracellular domain of FGFR3 and part of the TM domain. ECTMWT-3, ending at residue Ser445, contains the extracellular, TM, and a part of the juxtamembrane domain of FGFR3. NeuECTM contains the extracellular and TM domains of Neu, ending at residue Arg680.  Transfection and Immunostaining HEK 293 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the truncated receptors using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were cultured in normal medium for 24 h following transfection. After fixing with 3% paraformaldehyde, cells were blocked using bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with anti-N-FGFR3 antibodies (SC-9007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C, followed by secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen)). The distribution of the secondary antibodies was visualized using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon, Japan).  Flow Cytometry Measurements HEK 293 cells were transfected with a pcDNA 3.1(+) empty vector or the plasmid encoding ECTMWT-1. Twenty four hours later, cells were starved in serum-free DMEM for another 24 hours. The cells were suspended in 5 mm EDTA and washed with 3% FBS/PBS. ECTMWT-1 expressed on the cell surface was stained with anti-N-FGFR3 antibodies (SC-9007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The cells were then incubated in the solution of fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (401314, EMD Chemicals). Measurements were performed with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells expressing ECTMWT-1 was determined using FCS express software (De Novo Software).  Western Blots After culture in normal medium for 24 h following transfection and then starvation in serum-free medium for 24 h, cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm NaVO4, and protease inhibitor from Roche Applied Science). In some experiments cells were incubated in medium supplemented with FGF1 (Millipore, MA), before they were lysed. After spinning at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected, and the pellet was discarded. Protein concentration was determined using the BCATM assay kit (Pierce). The lysate was loaded into 3–8% NuPAGE® Novex® Tris acetate mini gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked in milk for 1 h at room temperature and then stained with either anti-N-FGFR3 (H-100) antibodies (sc-9007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-C-FGFR3 antibodies (sc-123, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or phospho-Tyr-FGFR antibodies (anti-Tyr653/654, Cell Signaling Technology). ECLTM detection reagent (GE Healthcare) was used to visualize the secondary anti-mouse or anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated antibodies (Promega). The bands were quantified using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).  Quantification of Western Blot Results and Statistical Analysis The Western blot films were scanned and processed with ImageQuant TL. At least three sets of independent experiments were performed to determine the averages, the standard deviations, and the standard errors.  The inhibition of the receptors in the stable lines was determined by taking the ratio of anti-Tyr653/654 staining intensities in the presence and absence of ECTMWT-1. Each data point was the result of three independent measurements, expressed as means ± S.E. To reduce the inordinate impact of the few measurements with fortuitously small errors, we assumed that all inhibition data had the same relative error. Composite errors were calculated from inhibition data with an intercept of 0.06 and a slope of 0.14, values that were determined by a linear regression analysis of measured standard errors versus inhibition.  To determine whether there was statistically significant inhibition across the range of ligand concentrations, we performed a χ2 test (21) in which the χ2 contribution of each point, i, is shown in Equation 1,  equation image where 1 is the expected value in the case of no inhibition. In a set of measurements in which the expected and observed values differ only by random experimental error, the χ2 values will have a mean of around 1, with a 95% confidence interval of about 0–2. The total reduced χ2 for the whole curve was calculated according to Equation 2,  equation image where df is the degrees of freedom (the number of points in the curve minus 1). The reduced χ2 will be approximately 1 if the data do not differ from the null hypothesis (no inhibition) by more than the experimentally determined standard errors. Once the reduced χ2 was calculated, we determined a p value for the null hypotheses that the observed values are sampled from a parent population with a mean equal to the expected value. The p values for the calculated reduced χ2 values were determined using a χ2 table (21) with a p value < 0.05 considered significant.  The χ2 test was also used to assess the statistical difference between different inhibition curves, a and b. In this case, reduced χ2 was calculated by summing the difference over the curves for each ligand concentration, i, as shown in Equation 3,  equation image where S.E.diff is the standard error of the difference between two points, calculated by error propagation shown in Equation 4,  equation image As above, the p value for the reduced χ2 was determined using a χ2 table (21), with a p value < 0.05 considered significant.  Go to: RESULTS Expression and Membrane Localization of Truncated FGFR3 The presence of a truncated RTK construct lacking the kinase domain is expected to decrease phosphorylation of full-length RTKs via the formation of inactive full-length/truncated dimers (Fig. 1). First, we sought to confirm this expectation for FGFR3 by investigating whether a truncated FGFR3 construct without the kinase domain can indeed inhibit FGFR3 phosphorylation. Second, we sought to determine whether the exact point of truncation affects the inhibition. Toward this goal, we constructed plasmids encoding three different versions of truncated FGFR3, with extracellular and transmembrane domains but no kinase domains. The three plasmids (ECTMWT-1, ECTMWT-2, and ECTMWT-3), which differ in the exact point of truncation, are shown schematically in Fig. 2A. The hydrophobic membrane-embedded TM domain is underlined in Fig. 2A. We also created a similarly truncated version of an unrelated RTK, Neu, also shown in Fig. 2A, to serve as a control.  FIGURE 2. FIGURE 2. A, FGFR3 and Neu constructs used in the study. The abbreviations used are as follows: EC, extracellular domain; TM, transmembrane domain; JM, juxtamembrane domain; KIN, kinase domain. B, immunofluorescence staining of the truncated FGFR3 constructs (ECTM ... HEK 293 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the four truncated receptors. Twenty four hours after transfection, the localization of these truncated receptors on the cell surface was detected via immunostaining without permeabilization, using antibodies against the N termini of the truncated receptors (anti-N-FGFR3 or anti-N-Neu antibodies), followed by fluorescent secondary antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2B, all four truncated receptors are expressed on the cell surface.  Next, we used Western blotting to probe the expression and the molecular weight of the truncated FGFR3 constructs (ECTMWT-1, ECTMWT-2, and ECTMWT-3). In these experiments HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the truncated receptor, and lysed; the lysates were subjected to Western blotting. The cellular proteins were separated by molecular weight using SDS-PAGE, and the expression of the truncated FGFR3 constructs was detected by blotting with anti-N-FGFR3 (SC-9007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies that recognize the extracellular domain of FGFR3. The results are shown in Fig. 2C.  The full-length FGFR3 has the following three forms, with different degrees of N-glycosylation: a 98-kDa native form which is rarely observed, a 120-kDa partially glycosylated form, and a 130-kDa fully glycosylated form (22). The calculated molecular masses of the truncated receptors, based on their primary amino acid sequences, are 39, 40, and 46 kDa for ECTMWT-1, ECTMWT-2. and ECTMWT-3 respectively. As seen in Fig. 2C, there are two bands for each truncated FGFR3 at positions higher than their predicted molecular weight. These two bands correspond to the expected degrees of truncated receptor glycosylation.  Effect of Truncated FGFR3 on FGFR3 Phosphorylation in Stable Cell Lines Three stable HEK 293 cell lines, expressing FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, and FGFR3/A391E, were created as described under “Materials and Methods.” The G380R mutant is linked to achondroplasia, the most common form of short limb human dwarfism, and the A391E mutant is linked to Crouzon syndrome (a craniosynostosis) with acanthosis nigricans (a skin disorder). The three stable cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the truncated receptors, ECTMWT-1, ECTMWT-2, and ECTMWT-3 and NeuECTM. Cells transfected with an empty pcDNA 3.1+ vector served as a control. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cell culture medium was replaced by serum-free medium. Another 24 h later, cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of the ligand FGF1. After incubating with the ligand for 10 min, cells were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed. The lysates were subjected to Western blotting (see supplemental Fig. S1). The phosphorylation of full-length wild-type and mutant FGFR3 in the three stable cell lines was detected using anti-p-FGFR3 (anti-Tyr653/654). Although these antibodies have been generated to recognize phosphorylated Tyr653 and Tyr654 in FGFR1, they also specifically recognize the analogous Tyr647 and Tyr648 in FGFR3 (13). Tyr647 and Tyr648 are located in the activation loop of FGFR3 kinase domain and are essential for FGFR3 biological function. The total FGFR3 expression, however, was probed using anti-C-FGFR3 antibodies, which are reactive to the C terminus of FGFR3 and thus detect only full-length FGFR3 but not the truncated receptors.  Fig. 3 shows the results of three independent Western blot experiments and demonstrates that all three FGFR3 truncated constructs inhibited the phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant FGFR3, with phosphorylation levels reduced to about 20% of the control. The truncated Neu construct, however, did not inhibit significantly either wild-type FGFR3 or the two mutants, despite the fact that it is expressed similarly on the cell surface (Fig. 2B). In particular, the calculated p values for the null hypothesis of no inhibition by NeuECTM according to Student's t test were 0.27, 0.47, and 0.68 for FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, and FGFR3/A391E, respectively, demonstrating a lack of significant effect. Thus, all three FGFR3 truncated constructs, ECTMWT-1, ECTMWT-2, and ECTMWT-3, inhibited the activation of FGFR3 in a specific manner. Importantly, there were no significant differences in the effects of these three truncated receptors on the phosphorylation of the wild type and the two mutants, indicating that the exact point of truncation is not critical. One of the truncated receptors, ECTMWT-1, was selected for further studies.  FIGURE 3. FIGURE 3. Effect of the truncated receptors on the phosphorylation levels of FGFR3/WT (A), FGFR3/G380R (B), and FGFR3/A391E (C) in stable cells. In these experiments HEK 293 cells, stably expressing full-length receptors, were transfected with plasmids encoding ... Expression of Full-length Receptors and ECTMWT-1 in the Three Stable Cell Lines FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, and FGFR3/A391E stable cells were transfected with the plasmid encoding ECTMWT-1. The stable expression of full-length FGFR3 was probed using anti-C-FGFR3 antibodies. One representative Western blot is shown in supplemental Fig. S3A. We conducted three independent experiments for each of the three stable lines, and in Fig. 4A we show the averages and the standard errors for the three stable lines (the expression of the wild-type is assigned a value of 1). The p value from one-way ANOVA is 0.46, demonstrating that there are no significant differences in the stable expression of wild-type FGFR3 and the two mutants in the three stable lines.  FIGURE 4. FIGURE 4. A, expression of full-length FGFR3 in the three stable lines. Averages and standard errors were calculated from three independent experiments. The p value from one-way ANOVA is 0.46, indicating that there is no statistical difference among the expression ... The transient expression of ECTMWT-1 in the cells was probed using anti-N-FGFR3 antibodies. A typical Western blot is shown in supplemental Fig. S3B. After conducting four independent experiments for each of the stable lines, we show the average expression of ECTMWT-1 in the three stable cells, along with the standard errors, in Fig. 4B (the expression of ECTMWT-1 in the wild-type stable line is assigned a value of 1). The p value from one-way ANOVA is 0.2, demonstrating that the expression of ECTMWT-1 is the same in the three stable cell lines.  Because the anti-N-FGFR3 antibody recognizes the epitope corresponding to amino acids 25–124 within the extracellular domain of FGFR3, it can detect both full-length FGFR3 and ECTMWT-1. Upon increasing the exposure time, both full-length FGFR3 and ECTMWT-1 could be observed (supplemental Fig. S2C). The expression level of ECTMWT-1 is an order of magnitude higher than the expression of full-length FGFR3 in the three stable cell lines. Under these conditions, mass action dictates that heterodimers between full-length and truncated receptors are preferred over active FGFR3 homodimers (see “Discussion”).  Inhibitory Effect of ECTMWT-1 Over a Wide Ligand Concentration Range To gain further insight into the inhibition, we assessed the inhibitory effect of ECTMWT-1 over a wide ligand concentration range. We transfected the stable cell lines, expressing either FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, or FGFR3/A391E, with plasmids encoding either ECTMWT-1 or an empty pcDNA 3.1+ vector, and we analyzed the phosphorylation of the stably expressed receptors using Western blotting. Typical Western blot films are shown in Figs. 55–7 for FGFR3/WT, for FGFR3/G380R, and for FGFR3/A391E, respectively.  FIGURE 5. FIGURE 5. Effect of ECTMWT-1 on FGFR3/WT phosphorylation in stable cell lines, as a function of ligand (FGF1) concentration. HEK 293 cells stably expressing FGFR3/WT were transfected with plasmids encoding ECTMWT-1 or an empty vector. Cells were stimulated with ... FIGURE 6. FIGURE 6. Effect of ECTMWT-1 on FGFR3/G380R phosphorylation in stable cell lines, as a function of ligand (FGF1) concentration. FIGURE 7. FIGURE 7. Effect of ECTMWT-1 on FGFR3/A391E phosphorylation in stable cell lines, as a function of ligand (FGF1) concentration. Figs. 55–7 show the band staining intensities of anti-C-FGFR3 (SC-123) antibodies (bottom films) and anti-Tyr653/654 antibodies (top films). These films report the expression and the phosphorylation of the full-length receptors, respectively. The truncated FGFR3 construct is not detected by either of these antibodies. In all cases, we observe two bands that are reactive to anti-FGFR3 antibodies, corresponding to the 120-kDa immature and the 130-kDa mature fully glycosylated FGFR3 isoforms. Below, we quantify only the intensity of the highest molecular weight band, corresponding to the mature receptor located predominantly in the plasma membrane and activated in the presence of the ligand (22).  In Figs. 55–7 we observe strong phosphorylation of the mature FGFR3 isoform in the absence of ECTMWT-1, which increases with increasing FGF1 concentration. At concentrations in the range 125–1000 ng/ml FGF1, we observe a plateau in the phosphorylation; the phosphorylation level does not change as more ligand is added. We have previously observed such a plateau at high ligand concentrations in transient transfection experiments (13). This plateau is rationalized by the fact that at such high ligand concentrations all receptors that are accessible to ligand have responded to it, and FGFR3 phosphorylation is at its highest level possible (13).  In the presence of ECTMWT-1, the phosphorylation of the three mature FGFR3 receptors increases with ligand concentration, but it is always lower than in the absence of ECTMWT-1. Thus, the truncated wild-type constructs inhibit the activation of FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/A391E, and FGFR3/G380R. To measure this effect, we first quantified the bands corresponding to the highest molecular weight mature fully glycosylated FGFR3. For successful quantification, the loading of the gels was such that all the band intensities were within the so-called “linear range,” where the staining intensities were proportional to the protein concentrations (23). To plot results for the three receptors on the same scale, the highest phosphorylation level observed for each receptor was assigned a value of 1. The calculated phosphorylation levels in the presence and absence of ECTMWT as a function of ligand concentration (activation curves) are presented in Fig. 8.  FIGURE 8. FIGURE 8. Phosphorylation of FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, and FGFR3/A391E in the presence and absence of ECTMWT-1. The results are obtained via quantification of Western blot films such as the ones shown in Figs. 55–7. The averages and the standard errors ... Next, we divided the measured FGFR3 phosphorylation in the presence of ECTMWT-1, PECTMWT-1, by that of each corresponding control (P, in the absence of ECTMWT-1), and then we plotted the ratios PECTMWT-1/P, a measure of the inhibitory effect of ECTMWT-1, versus FGF1 concentrations. The resultant inhibition curves are shown in Fig. 9; a ratio below 1 is indicative of inhibition. The errors shown are standard errors.  FIGURE 9. FIGURE 9. Inhibition curves, ratios of measured phosphorylation of FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/G380R, and FGFR3/A391E in the presence and absence of ECTMWT-1. We then examined the statistical significance of the observed inhibition. First, we evaluated the inhibition over the entire ligand concentration range by assessing if the results are statistically different from a value of 1, the null hypothesis for no inhibition. Toward this goal we calculated the statistical significance of the whole curves using a χ2 test given by Equations 1 and 2. The results are shown in Table 1, and they demonstrate that the inhibition curves for FGFR3/WT, FGFR3/A391E, and FGFR3/G380R are highly significantly different from 1. Thus, ECTMWT-1 inhibits the phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant FGFR3 over a wide ligand concentration range.  TABLE 1 TABLE 1 Analysis of inhibition by ECTMWT-1 over a wide ligand concentration range Next, we sought to identify the ligand concentration range, over which the inhibition of the three receptors is the highest. The contribution of each point to the sum of χ2 (Equation 1) is shown in Fig. 10; the 95% confidence interval for random distribution is about 0–2 as shown by the gray area. There is a statistically significant inhibitory effect of ECTMWT-1 on FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E over the entire ligand concentration range. The inhibition of FGFR3/G380R, however, is statistically significant only above 10 ng/ml FGF1.  FIGURE 10. FIGURE 10. Individual contributions to χ2 from the three inhibition curves shown in Fig. 9. The y axis is a measure of the statistical significance of difference between inhibition and no inhibition. If there is no statistical difference, each χ ... Next, we investigated if there are statistically significant differences between the three inhibition curves shown in Fig. 9. To answer this question, we compared the three pairs of inhibition curves for (i) FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E, (ii) FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/G380R, and (ii) FGFR3/A391E and FGFR3/G380R in a χ2 test using Equation 3. The results are shown in Table 2, and they demonstrate that the FGFR3/G380R inhibition curve is significantly different from the FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E inhibition curves. However, the FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E inhibition curves are not statistically different from each other.  TABLE 2 TABLE 2 Comparison of inhibition by ECTMWT-1 over a wide ligand concentration range To assess the ligand concentration range over which the differences are the largest, in Fig. 11 we show the contributions of each point to the sum of χ2 from the three difference curves. The gray area in Fig. 11 shows the 95% confidence interval of the χ2 values expected if there is no statistical difference other than random error. Note that the most significant differences between the FGFR3/G380R inhibition curve and the other two inhibition curves occur at low ligand concentrations, below 125 ng/ml ligand. Above 125 ng/ml, none of the curves are different from each other (also shown in Table 2).  FIGURE 11. FIGURE 11. Individual contributions to χ2 from the differences between the inhibition curves. The gray area is where the χ2 values will be found if there is no statistical difference. The most significant differences occur up to 125 ng/ml ligand. ... Inhibitory effect of ECTMWT-1 in the absence of ligand To further investigate if the activation of FGFR3 is inhibited by ECTMWT-1 in the absence of ligand, we performed additional inhibition experiments without ligand. To determine whether there is statistically significant inhibition, we performed a Student's t test using a null hypothesis of 1 (no inhibition). The calculated p values are shown in Table 3. To evaluate the significance, we used the Bonferroni correction for multiple pairwise comparisons, such that the p value cutoff for significance was 0.02 for each comparison, rather than 0.05 normally used for single comparisons. The results in Table 3 show that the effect of ECTMWT-1 on FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E activation was statistically significant. However, ECTMWT-1 did not inhibit the activity of FGFR3/G380R in the absence of ligand.  TABLE 3 TABLE 3 Analysis of inhibition by ECTMWT-1 in the absence of ligand Next, we asked if there are statistically significant differences in the unliganded inhibition of the three receptors by ECTMWT-1. To answer this question, we compared their inhibition in the absence of ligand using ANOVA and the Tukey-Kramer test for pairwise comparisons. The results, shown in Table 4, show that the inhibitions of FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/G380R by ECTMWT-1 are significantly different from each other in the absence of ligand. Similarly, the inhibitions of the two mutants by ECTMWT-1 are significantly different from each other, but the effects of ECTMWT-1 on the activation of FGFR3/A391E and FGFR3/WT are similar.  TABLE 4 TABLE 4 Comparison of unliganded inhibition via ANOVA analysis of the three sets of unliganded inhibition data Go to: DISCUSSION Summary of Findings Our findings can be summarized as follows. 1) The three FGFR3 receptors (WT, G380R, and A391E) are inhibited significantly by ECTMWT-1 over a wide ligand concentration range (Table 1 and Fig. 10). 2) The inhibitory effect of ECTMWT-1 on FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E is significantly larger than its effect on FGFR3/G380R (Table 1 and Fig. 10). 3) The differences between the measured inhibitory effects occur up to 125 ng/ml ligand. Above 125 ng/ml ligand the effects are indistinguishable (Table 2 and Fig. 11). 4) In the absence of ligand, FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E are inhibited by ECTMWT-1, although FGFR3/G380R is not inhibited (Table 3). 5) FGFR3/WT and FGFR3/A391E are inhibited similarly by ECTMWT-1 in the absence of ligand (Table 4).  The conclusion of these studies is that the WT/G380R heterodimers form with lower probability than the WT/WT homodimers or the WT/A391E heterodimers for FGF1 concentrations lower than 125 ng/ml. Under these conditions, there is a large fraction of unliganded dimers, and the TM domains contribute significantly to interactions between FGFR3 receptors (24). At high ligand concentrations, where most dimers are liganded, and where the extracellular domains dominate the interactions between receptors, the mutations have little or no effect on dimerization. Indeed, here we find that the likelihoods for WT/WT homodimers, WT/G380R heterodimers, and WT/A391E heterodimers are indistinguishable at higher ligand concentrations.  Discussion of Experimental Design Here we assess the formation of heterodimers between a wild-type truncated construct lacking the catalytic domain, ECTMWT-1, and full-length wild-type and mutant FGFR3 receptors, stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Such full-length/truncated heterodimers are inactive (Fig. 1). Their formation depletes the pool of full-length receptors capable of forming active homodimers and reduces the concentration of active WT/WT, G380R/G380R and A391E/A391E homodimers. Thus, the propensities for FGFR3 wild-type homodimerization and WT/A391E and WT/G380R heterodimerization can be compared.  ECTMWT-1 is expressed in about 70% of the cells because it is introduced via transient transfection (see supplemental Fig. S2). The remainder of the stable cells do not express the truncated constructs but are part of the cell pool assayed in the experiments. The cells that do not express ECTMWT-1 reduce the measured inhibitory effect of the construct. Nonetheless, the effects are measurable and reproducible, and they can be compared using statistical analysis, based on the following facts: 1) the stable expressions of the three full-length receptors are the same (Fig. 4A), and 2) the transient expression of ECTMWT-1 in the three stable lines is also the same (Fig. 4B).  The expression of ECTMWT-1 is an order of magnitude higher than the expression of full-length FGFR3 in the three stable cell lines (supplemental Fig. S3C). According to the law of mass action, under these conditions the heterodimers between full-length and truncated receptors are preferred over active FGFR3 homodimers. Although it is possible that the deletion of the intracellular domain affects dimerization, the relative propensities for the formation of WT homodimers and WT/G380R and WT/A391E heterodimers can be compared because the expression levels of the full-length RTKs and ECTMWT-1 in the three stable lines are the same (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, it should be noted that there is always excess of free ligand, even at the lowest ligand concentration (see supplemental material), such that the observed inhibitory effects are not due to ligand depletion by ECTMWT-1.  Molecular Mechanism behind FGFR3-associated Pathologies The A391E mutation in FGFR3 has been identified as a somatic mutation in bladder cancer (25) and as a germ line mutation in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (18), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by premature ossification of the skull (craniosynostosis) and skin hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis. The A391E mutation stabilizes the isolated FGFR3 TM domain homodimer in lipid bilayers by −1.3 kcal/mol, most probably via hydrogen bonding (26). The mutation increases the activation and the cross-linking propensity of a chimeric Neu receptor containing the FGFR3 TM domain in CHO cells by about −1.0 kcal/mol (23). The mutation also increases the stability of the heterodimer of the wild-type/mutant FGFR3 TM domains in lipid bilayers by −0.6 kcal/mol (16).  Furthermore, molecular modeling has suggested that the TM domain dimer structures of the wild-type FGFR3 and the pathogenic A391E mutant are similar, and therefore mutant dimer stabilization is a direct consequence of the interaction (most probably hydrogen bonding) between Glu391 and the adjacent helix in the dimer (26). In other words, the dimerization motif does not change because of the mutation, but instead a new hydrogen bond is added to further stabilize the dimer.  The G380R mutation associated with achondroplasia, however, does not increase FGFR3 dimerization (13, 27). Instead, FGFR3 activity in achondroplasia is increased due to increased probability for phosphorylation in the absence of ligand (13). Computer modeling of the FGFR3 TM domain dimer carrying the G380R mutation suggests that the mutation induces a rotation in the TM dimer interface (13). Such rotations of RTK TM dimer interfaces have been linked to changes in auto-phosphorylation propensities (28).  Because the structures of the wild-type and G380R homodimers are expected to be different, no prediction can be made about the formation/stability of WT/G380R heterodimers. Here, we show experimentally that WT/G380R heterodimers form with lower probability than WT/WT homodimers and WT/A391E heterodimers for low FGF1 concentrations. The likelihoods for WT/WT homodimers, WT/G380R heterodimers, and WT/G380R heterodimers are similar to each other at higher ligand concentrations.  The G380R and A391E mutations are localized in the TM domain of the same receptor. Yet the two mutations are linked to different phenotypes. The G380R mutation affects the development of the long bones, whereas the A391E mutation leads to premature ossification of the skull in the coronal area (20, 29). Long bones and cranial bones develop via different pathways. The long bones develop via endochondral ossification, i.e. as hypertrophic chondrocytes die, the space is invaded by bone. The cranial bones develop as a result of differentiation of mesenchymal cells into bone. Currently, it is not clear why these two mutations in the same receptor give rise to different phenotypes.  Previous work has already revealed a difference in the effects of these two mutations; A391E increases FGFR3 activation by increasing dimerization, whereas G380R likely affects the structure of the dimer in the absence of ligand (8, 9). Here, we demonstrate a second key difference between the two mutants. Although WT/A391E heterodimers readily form in cellular membranes, WT/G380R heterodimers form with lower probability than WT/WT homodimers and WT/A391E heterodimers for low FGF1 concentrations. The difference in interactions that we measure here may help explain the different phenotypic effects due to these two mutations.


